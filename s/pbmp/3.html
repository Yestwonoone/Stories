    I arrived at the same school early in the morning again. I decided not to go to the back of the classroom yesterday in the afternoon, since I don't feel good being with her and I thought maybe she's sitting in the chair again at that time.

    I want to avoid her...

    I just hope she would stop doing that. If she would just say she wanted the chair then I will give it to her, but she didn't say anything like that, so I don't have any reason to stop going on the secret place, that's not a proper reason to stop visiting the secret place.

    It's not that I own it or anything, but I will gladly let her enjoy the secret place as an apology to what I did. Besides because of that situation, I can't say it's still a secret place now that she knew about this place.

    But of course, I will not take back what I just said, I mean it, and I will not take it back.

    Now let's see if she is here.

    It's empty.

    "Finally.". Inner peace I must say.

    That's for the best, I want this peaceful place to be mine only. I know I'm greedy, but I just hate the fact that she came here bringing such an uncomfortable feeling to the place that supposed to be relaxing.

    Am I evil for thinking like this? That's the first time I made someone cried, and that's the result of myself being honest, or being harsh, I guess?

    I can't understand her intentions that's why I said all of that. I don't want to lie when it will just bring bigger problems later on, maybe a person other than me would say things in different and in more soft way...

    But that's not me, I am myself, and I will act as myself.

    I took a seat on the chair.

    It's so quiet right now, as there are only few students this early morning, and I'm the only present student from our class at the moment, making this area really peaceful and quiet.

    So relaxing...

    I just hope this peaceful time continues, that's my everyday wish, that's my ultimate wish.

    <p style="text-align: center">***</p>
    It's lunch break.

    After finishing eating my lunch at the classroom, I decided to visit the secret chair once again, it's my daily routine.

    I took a seat on the chair.

    It's not that quiet anymore since I can hear my classmate's voice just behind me, but other than that it's still peaceful here on the back of our classroom.

    I mean I'm the only person you could find at this place, and in front of me is a tall concrete wall not that far. There's no tree in here, only a chair, but the area is not that small so it's not suffocating.

    As always, I will spend my free time in here before the class starts.

    I just love this place.

    "Oh....."

    She's here and she's slowly approaching...

    What to do... She's here again...

    "Hey?" She called me.

    "What?"

    She didn't answer me, but instead she took a sit beside me.

    Please don't ruin my day again...

    "Hey..."

    "Stop repeating that, tell me, what are you planning now?"

    "Will you listen to my story?"

    "Your story? Why would I listen to someone's story, isn't that only possible to someone who is close to you? Why me?”. We are not even close right? Why would she do this. “After what I said yesterday, it's incredible how you can talk to me like nothing happened.", I continued.

    "You see I have this friend."

    "I didn't even say I will listen to it...” *sigh*

    She already started even though I didn't say I will be listening to it.

    "I met him at the same place as we are right now, and we had a little fight about who is going to be the owner of this place. That's our first meeting."

    So, she arrived first here before I find this place, and I'm not the first one...

    I guess she is the first owner then.

    "He was a good friend of mine. He listens to my stories, and we talked about many things here in this chair. That was really a happy time for me, that someone would listen to my stories."

    "Then good for you."

    Really. I’m not the type to talk about stories about myself, so I don’t really know.

    "One time we talked about pets."

    "Uhh... Okay?"

    "He said that pets are nice, and he loves taking care of their pets. But he said he wasn't that much of an animal lover, nonetheless he still loves having pets. 'They are a real family' he said. He is happy with them, he wants to take care of them, and he wants to grow old with them. That’s what he said when we are talking about the pets."

    …

    "He said, 'Pets are someone you can trust, they are loyal, and someone you can love. I do mess with them sometimes, but that’s just my way of playing with them. But in short, I just wanted to say that pets are nice to be with.’”

    Sounds like a pet lover to me, he does appreciate a lot being with pets.

    "Oh, I see.". To be honest that person sounds familiar to me.

    "Then one time he said this to me, 'Please be my pet.'."

    He said what?

    "It came as a shock to me. I told him stop joking around, and I said why should I become his pet."

    Exactly my reaction, but why... why would she tell me something like that?

    "But then why-"

    "That's the story I want to tell you.". My question got interrupted.

    "That, that was an unusual way of ending the story.”

    What kind of ending is that.

    "Sorry Sed..."

    "About what?"

    Huh?

    "Wait... What are you talking about? And why do you know my name?". How did she know about it?

    "I'm sorry about what I did, I should have never asked you to be my pet.”

    "Well, that's fine, but I don't quite understand why you felt the need to share a story with me that I can't fully understand. It would be great if you could communicate more clearly, as that would have prevented our fight at the first place.", I said.

    *cries*

    Again? What's with this girl?

    "I’m sorry for being selfish.”

    "I already accepted your apology, there's no reason to overreact."

    This girl is more sensitive than I thought.

    "I love you, Sed. I love you so much.", She said in a low voice.

    My eyes widened, and I gave her a confused look. 

    I can't understand what's happening.

    "I love how you let me stay by your side even for a short period of time. I wish you would love me too and I wish that we can talk about more things. I wish time would stop, and I wish I met you sooner."

    “I cherish the moments we’ve spent together even for a short period of time. I hope you feel the same way about me and that we can share more meaningful and fun conversations. I wish… I wish the time would stop.”

    Although I have no idea what she's talking about... I feel bad.

    "If I love you once before, then I’ll love you as twice now.", She continued.

    What's that even supposed to mean?

    "I have a question...", she asked.

    "A question?"

    "Please be honest with me... Do you love me?", She said slowly.

    I closed my eyes for a few seconds.

    "I don't love you."

    "I see... This is unfair..."

    "I don't know what you are talking about."

    "I know, you don't know anything about me until now. There's no way you could love someone like that easily, right?"

    "Yes. Basically, I know nothing about you."

    "I'm Pearl."

    So, it's Pearl...

    "So... Pearl, can I ask you a question?"

    "What is it?"

    "Why are you confessing your love to the air?"

    She looks at me with a confusing look after I said it.

    "What do you mean?"

    "I personally love your confession, I was moved. But you're confessing to a wrong person. You're confessing to the air...”. Simply because the Sed she is talking about is nowhere to be find.

    “Earlier you said Sed, right?", I continued.

    "Because I was talking about you, why can't you understand that?"

    "Stop joking around, I don't have any idea what you are talking about. The Sed you are talking is someone that doesn't exist. The Sed you're talking about is a complete lie, that Sed only exists in your memories and in your imagination."

    "Stop saying that..."

    One more push.

    "Don't you think you're just dreaming? I'm not the Sed you are talking about, you probably got the wrong person."

    "But Sed...". She looks down.

    "Sed...". She started crying again.

    "Sed... I miss you.". She covered her eyes with both of her hands.

    Who is this Sed she is talking about anyway? I don't remember meeting her, and she doesn't look like she is lying. It looks genuine to be a lie, but I don’t remember any of this.

    I'm confused.

    "Hey..."

    *cries*

    "Hey Pearl!"

    "W-what?"

    "Do you want to make a new Sed?"

    "Uh?"

    "Can you stop crying over and over again? I can't talk to you properly."

    "O-okay..."

    "But first, do you want this place to be yours?"

    "That's not my plan."

    "Okay good. So-"

    "But I want to share it with you."

    "O-oh, I see..." *sigh*

    "So, as I said earlier, I will help you create a new Sed, as an apology for making you cry many times.", I continued.

    "Meaning?"

    "Meaning, I'm willing to be your friend."

    "Really?"

    "In one condition."

    "What is it?"

    "Never tell anyone about this place."

    "That's my plan from the start."

    "Glad to hear that. I guess I'm done here, you are free to visit here again."

    I stood up and started walking.

    "Huh?"

    …

    She hugs me from behind.

    "Hey... What do you think you're doing. Do you want me to punch you?"

    "Thank you, I love you.", She said while hugging me.

    "Stop hugging me from behind!". I can’t get away. This is such a monstrous hug.

    "I'm glad you are the person I fall in love with. You're such a cool guy."

    "What made you think that I am cool? I’m nowhere near to be that kind of guy."

    "Your very existence makes you cool. Even then and now, you are the same Sed."

    Then and now?

    "What is that supposed to mean?"

    She finally releases her hands from me. She then walked in front of me and stopped to face me.

    "Sed, Please be my pet."

    "I refuse.", I immediately respond.

    "In percentage?"

    "99.99%"

    "What about the 0.01% you've left out?"

    "It would be rude to make it a hundred percent, the remaining percentage is what you call, respect."

    She chuckled.

    "Then..."

    "Then what?"

    "Please accept my love."

    "I can’t accept that."

    "Let's leave it at that... Thanks, Sed."

    Smiling. She’s smiling in front of my face. It's beautiful. My face started overheating.

    She then walks away from me slowly, until I can't see her anymore from my sight.

    The bell chimes.
