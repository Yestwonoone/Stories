    I always prefer going to school early to chill myself at the back of our classroom.

    There is this abandoned wooden chair enough for 3 people at the back of our classroom, it is the only chair you can find at the back of the classrooms and one would think why is there even a chair at this place.
    
    It could be that some senior students who got on the same classroom decided to put this on the back on the classroom in the past.
    
    Maybe to chill themselves just like me, I guess?
    
    This place is quiet and the best place to relax yourself. That's why I always find myself going on this place every day.
    
    I said always but that's a lie. It's been only a day since the school started, and a day since I discovered this chair.
    
    It feels like it's a fate that I discovered this chair by chance. I found this chair while walking around the school.
    
    I want to own this place as my own, my own secret place, but that's unlikely to happen anymore.
    
    Just yesterday, I decided to stay after school and relax myself at the same place, when some random girl suddenly asked me to be her pet out of nowhere.
    
    This could be the end of my own secret place, it's not that I own it, I'm just borrowing it... But I do hope I gain ownership of this place.
    
    That's right, I don't own it anymore, now that the same girl from yesterday is sitting on the same chair early this morning.
    
    "You're here again? Are you going to ask me to be your pet again? Please leave." I said.
    
    "I didn't accomplish my mission yet, that's why I cannot leave yet."
    
    "You're bothering me, so please leave. I don't know why you’re doing this, but please stop, this is not funny."
    
    "You see I'm not joking around either."
    
    "Really? Then sorry I will not help you accomplish your mission. Now please leave and find someone who will be willing to be your pet. What kind of joke is this."
    
    "I see..."
    
    She's crying...
    
    "Now you're crying, I may have said too much but I'm being serious here. I want to take sit at the chair you’re currently sitting and relax myself, if you are here then, I can't do that anymore."
    
    She remain silent.
    
    "If you don't have something else to say other than wanting me to be your pet, then please leave."
    
    "Please be my pet."
    
    "You... You are starting to get annoying. I don't want to say things any more than this but you leave me no choice. If you don't make yourself clear then I will not be able to understand you. Honestly I don’t even know you but here I am, thinking that you are crazy, which is obviously is not true because I don’t even know you well. But one thing for sure, you're really annoying right now. I don't understand your intentions, if you want to sit on this chair just say so then I will decide to leave this chair to you, it will be your own chair starting today. If you still want me to be your pet, give up, I will never do that, that's ridiculous."
    
    "Being a pet is not ridiculous."
    
    What is this person even talking about?
    
    "Until you decided to ask a person to be a pet, that's when things started to look ridiculous."
    
    "Is this how you really view what I just asked?"
    
    "Yes, it's completely a joke, I can't take it seriously at all. I don't want to be a pet, that's it. Please don't talk to me anymore if that's all you’re going to talk about, you’re giving me a problem."
    
    "Why is it the same..."
    
    And...
    
    She cries once again.
    
    "How am I supposed to react if this is how you respond me? Tell me, did I said something wrong enough to make you cry? Just because I rejected your mission? If that's the case, I'm sorry."
    
    "You feel sorry?"
    
    "That's because it feels like I'm bullying a child, it feels like telling a child that Santa Claus isn't real, that's what I feel about this whole situation with you. I rejected the whole pet mission you're talking about, and now you're crying. Although I can't help but think this whole thing is a joke, when you started crying, I can't help but feel sorry. That's what I feel, that's my honest feeling. Now, please end this whole thing, I don’t want to feel this way again."
    
    *silence*
    
    No response? Okay then.
    
    "Did I make myself clear? You're the only one who didn't make yourself clear, but I won't bother with that anymore, let's end this whole thing... Okay? Now I will excuse myself, bye."
    
    I just want to sit, that's all.
    
    *sigh*
    
    "I will wait again for you tomorrow."
    
    Don't do this please, I just honestly give you what I think about this whole situation.
    
    You're making me feel bad.
    
    I turned my back away from her.
    
    "Wipe your face, the class is going to start. Also, there's no point on waiting for me, I will answer the same thing..."
    
    And started walking while leaving her behind.
