    The time has come to make myself took a seat on the same place all over again, and for some reason she is not here.

    Well as usual it's still too early for classes, they shouldn't have any reason to arrive here earlier than it should be.
    
    Nothing's happening.
    
    It's quiet and peaceful.
    
    This is such a happy time.
    
    I closed my eyes.
    
    ...
    
    ...
    
    ...
    
    "...Huh?"
    
    My head is lying on something soft.
    
    And it smells good.
    
    ...
    
    Pearl...
    
    Pearl? Wait... What? What's happening?
    
    "Why..."
    
    "Why?"
    
    "Why my head is on the top of something.”
    
    "How can you even act dumb?”
    
    “I’m not acting dumb. You can’t expect me to know everything.”
    
    "How is that a guy like you never heard of lap?"
    
    "I don't know, better ask my past self."
    
    "That's what I've been wanting to do."
    
    "Huh? You know that's impossible."
    
    "I know... Setting that aside, I'm glad you're enjoying sleeping over my something." *ahem*
    
    "My mistake, it's so sticky that I can't seem to get away from it."
    
    "You call that a reason?"
    
    “Yeah?”
    
    That was embarrassing…
    
    I immediately raise my head.
    
    "You're not so honest."
    
    "Am I?"
    
    "You are… Although it kind of hurts how you responded.”
    
    "I fail to understand why it hurts."
    
    ...
    
    ...
    
    ...
    
    For a few minutes, nothing happened.
    
    "Do you hate it?”
    
    "What exactly?"
    
    "About placing your head to my lap."
    
    "Not really, it's not that bad...”
    
    "I’m glad, It would be bad if I can't please you with my lap.”
    
    *sigh*
    
    "You see Pearl, I never said about me being uncomfortable with your lap, it was a new experience to me.”
    
    “I didn’t manage to do this in the past, or more like I didn’t have any chance to do this.”
    
    "I don't know what past you are talking about, and I don’t understand why you are doing this.”
    
    "You can't understand it because it was in the past."
    
    "I absolutely no idea what past you are talking about. Looks like you forgot I'm not the Sed you are talking about."
    
    "That's why I'm frustrated, just when... Just when will you start loving me?"
    
    "I'm surprised on how can you even say that to me, we recently just became friends and you already love me?"
    
    "I'm....."
    
    "Don't ask me questions like that. If I can answer you other than 'I don't know' then I would. You can't expect me to answer that will please you, I'm not a God."
    
    "Sorry."
    
    "Don't mind it."
    
    "I will go home now.", she immediately said.
    
    "Hey wait, what about the class?"
    
    "You're 3 hours late."
    
    "Wait, I am? Why didn't you tell me anything? You could wake me up."
    
    "It's my first time seeing your sleeping face, it was funny. Plus, you're defenseless."
    
    "Can you please sit again, just for-"
    
    "I don't feel good right now. Can I go home?"
    
    "Okay, that's too bad. What about classes?"
    
    "We're both late anyway, and I have a proper reason to go home, since I don't feel so good."
    
    "Then would you like me to come with you to home?"
    
    "No thanks, that would be really unpleasant."
    
    "Unpleasant? Oh really... Then, see you tomorrow, I will wait for you."
    
    "Please don't do that."
    
    Eh?
    
    "What do you mean? Hey, Pearl! Wait for me."
    
    "Please don't say that, and don't follow me."
    
    "I'm sor-"
    
    She ran away from me, before I could even apologize to her...
    
    That must've hurt her a lot.
    
    I hate this, I don't like this.
    
    I need to apologize tomorrow.
    
    Tell me Pearl, how could you say something you love me so clearly and easily?
    
    If someone would tell me what is happening then I would be able to sleep well tonight.
    
    This is so pathetic.
    
    I started walking towards the gate...
    
    The guard is sitting not far away from the gate, but he is facing backwards.
    
    "Excuse me, can I excuse myself to go out? I have a toothache and my head slightly hurts."
    
    *silence*
    
    "Excuse me?"
    
    *silence*
    
    Maybe he can't hear me.
    
    ...
    
    Oh he's... Playing a game? What?
    
    That's insane, a guard playing a game while he's on duty? That's definitely something new to my eyes.
    
    Better not make any more noise...
    
    Besides, the gate is open anyways, I will just excuse myself without permission.
    
    And...
    
    I got out without any problems.
    
    Why is it open anyways? Maybe because of Pearl? She got out not too long ago, maybe she was the reason for it.
    
    Still, a guard playing a game while currently working, that's a new sight for sure.
