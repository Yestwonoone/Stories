    "Please be my pet."

    A girl I don't have any idea who is, suddenly approaches me, took a seat beside me, and just said an unbelievable thing.
    
    "Hey, I don't really want to ask you like this but... Are you okay?"
    
    "Perfectly okay as you can see.", She said while smiling and putting her right hand on the top of her head.
    
    "Okay good to hear, but what you just did doesn’t really prove anything.”
    
    "You have a point.”
    
    "Then will you please excuse me?”
    
    I’m not in the mood to deal with someone like her.
    
    "I will wait for you tomorrow."
    
    "Please don't do that."
