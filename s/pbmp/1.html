    While I was relaxing my self in an abandoned chair at the back of the classroom, a student suddenly approaches me with an unexpected request…

    "Please be my pet."

    A girl I don't have any idea who is, suddenly approaches me, took a seat beside me, and just said an unbelievable thing.

    So, what is this supposed to mean?

    "Hey, I don't really want to ask you like this but... Are you okay?", I asked. 

    "Perfectly okay as you can see.", She said while smiling and putting her right hand on the top of her head.

    "Okay good to hear, but what you just did doesn’t really prove anything.”

    "You have a point.”

    A weird individual just appeared.

    "Then will you please excuse me?”

    I’m not in the mood to deal with someone like her.

    "I will wait for you tomorrow."

    "Please don't do that."

    Why would she do that?

    I don’t get it.
