    She's not here.

    I can't apologize.
    
    It's lunch time, and there's no sign of her being here.
    
    I can't relax at all, I've been waiting for her this whole time, to talk to her one more time. But it doesn't look like it will happen anytime now.
    
    "What to do..."
    
    I have nothing to do except to wait for her.
    
    Talk about problematic situation.
    
    ...
    
    ...
    
    ...
    
    "W-WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE!?", a girl shouted.
    
    Huh???
    
    "So noisy....."
    
    "WHO ARE YOU!?"
    
    *yawn*
    
    "You mean, who are you?"
    
    "That's the same thing."
    
    "Name yourself first before asking me... And stop shouting in front of a sleeping person."
    
    "You were sleeping?"
    
    "Isn't it obvious that I was sleeping here?"
    
    "It's not, I didn't even notice you, you're not even here a few seconds ago."
    
    "What a bad lie."
    
    "What is?"
    
    "About me not being here."
    
    "You're lying right?"
    
    "Now you are asking me the same thing."
    
    "I never saw anyone."
    
    "Huh?"
    
    "I never saw you, you just suddenly appeared."
    
    "You're telling me... Out of thin air, I appeared?"
    
    "Not sure, that would be creepy if that's the case."
    
    "I don't remember acquiring a skill like teleportation."
    
    "Is that so..."
    
    "Absolutely."
    
    "Now... Jokes aside."
    
    "Jokes aside?"
    
    "What are you?"
    
    "A human."
    
    "I see..."
    
    "What kind of question is that?"
    
    "You look confused..."
    
    "And you're the reason."
    
    "Think about what I just said, I'm also confused same as you... How about we both cool our minds first, I will be back later. See you."
    
    "Okay?"
    
    "Think about it, okay?"
    
    "Okay."
    
    "Wait... Can you do something for a second?"
    
    "What is it?"
    
    "Can you shout?"
    
    "Why?"
    
    "Just do it, the loudest shout you can do."
    
    "There are classes behind us."
    
    "Don't mind it, just do it."
    
    "I'll pass."
    
    "Hmmm... How about I will explain why I asked those questions earlier to you later?"
    
    "That's kind of small thing, compare to what I'm about to do, I could get the whole school to be my enemies."
    
    "That's exaggerating. But, will you do it or not?"
    
    *sigh*
    
    "Okay, okay, I will do it. Besides I'm curious to know what do you mean by those questions earlier."
    
    "Okay, do it."
    
    *inhale*
    
    "WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!!!!!"
    
    "Wow, what a monstrous shout."
    
    "You're satisfied?"
    
    "Yeah, thanks. See you later."
    
    "That's it? Okay..."
    
    And... She's gone.
    
    What was that shouting all about, that doesn't make any sense.
    
    Wait a second...
    
    Odd...
    
    There's no reaction from the classroom behind me.
    
    There should be someone who will look outside after hearing my loud shout anytime now, and for some reason that didn't even happen.
    
    "Okay, that's weird."
    
    But she's definitely more weird.
    
    And... I'm late for my afternoon class, I can't show my face when I'm an hour late.
    
    There are 2 hours left before the class ends, and maybe I should think about what she just said.
    
    Where should I start...
    
    I should start with, who is that person?
    
    I don't know... Maybe I'll ask her when we meet again.
    
    Next, She asked what I'm doing here...
    
    If I remember right I was sleeping, I'm hundred percent sure that I was sleeping on this chair all this time.
    
    And for the 2 main questions I found really odd...
    
    First, she said she didn't saw anyone here, which is obviously impossible.
    
    Because if one person for example, decided to take a seat or walk around on the back of classroom, you will immediately notice that there is a chair and that there is a person in here.
    
    In a small area like this, you wouldn't be able to miss someone even if they tried to escape.
    
    Now, with a person like me who will spend his free time sitting on the same chair for hours, and even sleeping on it, that's impossible.
    
    There's only a one way exit in here, and I don't remember walking while sleeping. I couldn't possibly disappear when I was sleeping on the chair this whole time.
    
    I never had a chance to question what is the whole story before she found me, it is impossible to think about this when I'm not the one who experienced it.
    
    There is no lie in this... I never moved, I was on the same place for an hour, and that's the truth.
    
    She said I suddenly appeared, that means she didn't really see me sleeping in here? How is that even possible, I'm not even a small person, that's just plainly doesn't make any sense.
    
    I don't know how would I answer her for this question, it could be that there's just something wrong with her eyesight that she didn't notice me? I guess that's the case, better leave it at that.
    
    For the second and the most interesting question...
    
    The 'What are you?' question.
    
    A question that is interesting but doesn't make any sense to me, for am I a human being, and I am hundred percent sure of it.
    
    It's strange, these questions are something out of place, and doesn't really make any sense to me at least.
    
    If I missed something, then me sleeping would be the reason, because I'm not aware of my surroundings.
    
    If she asked me a question like this, most likely she is questioning my being.
    
    Why would she even ask that kind of question? Because any person will be able to answer this easily without any problems, and they will most likely to answer that they are humans.
    
    But I'm one of the persons who will also question that question, because I can't help but think that it is strange to question someone like that to begin with.
    
    Simply means, there must be a reason.
    
    "Maybe she knew I'm an alien all along."
    
    I chuckled.
    
    Well, I still don't know her reason, and I can't arrive to the answer I want to reach. There's no point in thinking that deeply about it, because this is a question of a complete stranger.
    
    ...
    
    ...
    
    ...
    
    ".... up!"
    
    ...
    
    "..ke up!"
    
    Huh?
    
    "Hey wake up!"
    
    "You're... noisy."
    
    "What a fun life, just sleeping like you don't care anything about the world."
    
    "Sleeping is my way of living."
    
    She burst out a laughter.
    
    "That's one strange way of living."
    
    "Thank you very much."
    
    "You okay?"
    
    "I am okay, but you keep asking these odd questions to me."
    
    "Sorry about that, but again sorry in advance."
    
    "Huh?"
    
    "I am Dia."
    
    "Okay Dia."
    
    "How about you?"
    
    "Sed."
    
    "Okay, what is your year and class?"
    
    "Why I should answer-"
    
    "Just answer it."
    
    "I'm done."
    
    "It will not take too long, just a few more."
    
    "I'm just being interviewed this whole time."
    
    "Don't you also have questions for me?"
    
    "Right, I do have questions."
    
    "Then you can question me later, how about it?"
    
    "Okay... I'm first year in high school, and Class B."
    
    "What is the date today?"
    
    "What kind of question is that?"
    
    "Exactly how it sounds like."
    
    "August 20, 2038."
    
    She turn back for a while and face me again.
    
    "Okay... Can I go home now?"
    
    "What are you talking about I still have questions for you, you can't just run away like that."
    
    "You're scaring me..."
    
    "In what way? I didn't even say anything scary or did anything scary to you."
    
    "Nothing, since I'm done questioning you, you can question me back."
    
    What's with both Pearl and Dia?
    
    They keeps saying things incomplete that I don't even know where should I begin with.
    
    "Then what do you mean by me appearing out of nowhere?"
    
    "Exactly what it sounds like, I was walking straight on this area when I saw a chair, that chair you currently sitting. Then I took a seat, and out of nowhere you appeared beside me."
    
    "Wait, you're saying you didn't see me?"
    
    "That's what I've been saying even earlier."
    
    "Are you sure about that?"
    
    "I'm sure, given how small this area is, it's impossible not to notice you. Even if you sneaked behind me, I will still notice you, but that didn't happen."
    
    "Okay that's scary, and I can't argue with that, since I was sleeping all the time. But then, it's also possible that you are lying, right?"
    
    "Yes, it's possible that I'm lying, but do you think do you have any other choice but to believe what I just said?"
    
    "I don't think I don't have any other choice but to believe you, don't you forget I can also disagree with your story."
    
    "Fair enough, but that's for you to decide."
    
    "Then for my last question... What do you mean by your last question earlier?"
    
    "When you heard about it, what do you think?"
    
    "I think it was weird, I couldn't believe someone will question me like that."
    
    "I couldn't believe it myself either."
    
    "Then you are definitely a weirdo."
    
    "And you are worse than me."
    
    "You're saying that..."
    
    "Yes..."
    
    "I'm an alien?"
    
    "What?"
    
    "What?"
    
    "Do you seriously believe you're an alien?"
    
    "No, that's why I'm asking you."
    
    "But you’re not an alien."
    
    "How can you be sure that I'm not alien?"
    
    "Because you look like a person and we can understand each other?"
    
    "What if I'm a super intelligent alien?"
    
    "That's impossible, you don't even know you are living in the past."
    
    "This is the present, am I wrong?"
    
    "This is indeed the present."
    
    "Then how?"
    
    "Today's date is August 27, 2038."
    
    "That's Friday next week."
    
    "You mean today's Friday?"
    
    "How can I believe something like that?"
    
    She showed me her phone.
    
    "August 27, 2038..."
    
    ...
    
    What's this?
    
    I looked through the news, the social media, and different other platforms...
    
    It's not a lie.
    
    Today is August 27, 2038.
    
    "Now, do you believe me?"
    
    "Somehow... How did I even forget today's date... Unbelievable."
    
    "That's not the only thing."
    
    "What do you mean not the only thing?"
    
    She scans through her phone, and showed me the screen once again...
    
    "A high school student died after getting hit by a car... Okay? What now? Why are you showing this?"
    
    "Just read it."
    
    "Hmmm... Okay... At exactly 5:17PM, August 20, 2038, he died... That's one week ago according to you, and that's going to happen today according to my date."
    
    "Does that ring anything?"
    
    "It doesn't, I'm not familiar with this news. Also I believe you said I was living in the past, that means this accident will happen in the future... What's the time now?"
    
    "5:06PM."
    
    "In about 11 minutes, the accident will happen, that's if, we are in the past. So, how is this relevant?"
    
    "You really don't remember anything huh?"
    
    "What are you talking about?"
    
    "You see, that student is first year in Class B."
    
    "Oh, so a classmate of mine? But I didn't hear anything about it."
    
    I don't like where this is going.
    
    "Not really."
    
    "Can I go home now? I'm tired."
    
    "Hey why are you running, I'm not done yet."
    
    I don't want to believe this.
    
    "I'm not running away, besides this conversation took too long to finish."
    
    "Don't tell me you're scared? We're not even done yet."
    
    "Me? How do you know?"
    
    "I'm more scared than you are."
    
    "Oh really, then goodbye."
    
    "Stop acting, you don't even look like you're scared. Don't you want to hear the rest?"
    
    "This is just a fake story, I don't remember one of my classmates getting hit by a car, so it's absolutely not true."
    
    "Because it's not your classmate who died, but you."
    
    ...
    
    "What kind of joke is that?"
    
    "Then care to explain why you are living in the past?"
    
    "You're the one who said that to me."
    
    "You also confirmed it, that you are one week late from the present time."
    
    "I can't seem to take this thing too seriously."
    
    "Anyone would."
    
    "Then why tell me this?"
    
    "To help you."
    
    "Help me? How is this helping me?"
    
    "To help you remember what happened."
    
    "I don't remember dying."
    
    "You just forgot about it."
    
    "Lies."
    
    "Sed? Dia? What are you two doing?"
    
    "Pearl? What are you doing here?" Dia asked Pearl.
    
    Pearl...
    
    "Just visiting this area." Pearl answered.
    
    "Do you have any reason to?"
    
    "Uh..."
    
    "Oh yeah, how did you know who Sed is? And you can see him?"
    
    "I thought anyone know who he is after what happened."
    
    "Makes sense, then how can you see him?"
    
    "I don't know."
    
    They both knew each other?
    
    "You're not shocked as I thought you’re going to be, Pearl."
    
    That's because we already met.
    
    "Uh... I'm just quick to accept this kind of things... And you are also here, that somehow reduced the chance of me getting scared and shocked."
    
    Scared?
    
    Shocked?
    
    "What are you talking about Pearl? Why will you get scared of me?"
    
    "No... That’s... A lie."
    
    "What Pearl? You're saying that you’re not scared of seeing dead people as ghost?" Dia asked Pearl.
    
    "What... Do you mean?" I asked.
    
    "Dia what are you talking about? Sed is alive."
    
    "The whole school knew about the news, that Sed died on Friday last week. Or are you saying I'm lying, Pearl?"
    
    "You're not... But..."
    
    "Hahaha..."
    
    "Sed?"
    
    "You okay Sed?"
    
    "Hahaha... Are both of you okay?"
    
    "We are okay, but you don't look like you're okay." Dia said.
    
    What's happening?
    
    What's this...
    
    "Sed!"
    
    "Hey why are you crying Sed?"
    
    Pearl hugged me.
    
    "What are you two doing?"
    
    "Everything's alright Sed, don't worry about the thing she said."
    
    "I'm sorry about yesterday Pearl."
    
    "It's alright, okay?"
    
    Am I really dead?
    
    Then why I can feel Pearl's warmth.
    
    Then why I feel calm now that she hugged me.
    
    Can a dead person...
    
    Is it possible for a ghost to feel emotions?
    
    "Uh... You're crying... Sorry about that, I didn't expect you will cry... Sorry."
    
    "Pearl..."
    
    "Yes?"
    
    "I'm sorry I died."
    
    "Hm..."
    
    "I'm sorry I forgot."
    
    "Hm..."
    
    "I'm sorry I can't return your feelings."
    
    "Hm..."
    
    "For talking and meeting with me this week..."
    
    ...
    
    "Thanks."
    
    "Hm..."
    
    "Hey Dia, what's the time?"
    
    "What? Oh... Wait, wait, wait... It's already 5:14PM."
    
    "Okay, you can stop hugging me Pearl, I'm okay."
    
    "Hm..."
    
    "Hey Pearl, stop or I will punch you."
    
    "Hey Sed! Don't you ever punch Pearl!"
    
    "Hey Pearl!"
    
    She's crying...
    
    *sigh*
    
    "There's no point in crying Pearl, go look for someone else Pearl."
    
    No response.
    
    "Now you're not talking."
    
    I hugged Pearl.
    
    "Don't cry Pearl, it's not worth it."
    
    ...
    
    "If you don't talk I will touch you."
    
    ...
    
    "You want to get punched Sed?" Dia asked.
    
    "Please refrain from doing that."
    
    "Then behave yourself."
    
    "You're not gonna stop me?"
    
    "I’m not gonna stop you."
    
    "Huh?"
    
    Dia started walking away from us.
    
    And...
    
    She's gone.
    
    ...
    
    "Hey Pearl... Some idea just came into my mind..."
    
    ...
    
    "Do you want to be my pet?"
