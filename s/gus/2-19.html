    Cold. It’s freezing cold in here.

    I didn’t bring any jacket, and I never thought it would be this cold here tonight. Totally opposite from this morning where it’s incredibly hot… I might get sick because of this.

    I wonder what would happen if one of the students got sick? Can they skip the tests on the summer class?

    Well, if they are that good of a person, they might do that. But I guess it will be not possible, it looks like they don’t really care if a student died… Or maybe, if they are like one of those monsters who wants to torture a strong person, and not a weak person, then surely, they won’t touch a sick person. That might be a good thing if that’s the case.

    I’m currently sitting on the wooden bench in the park.

    There’s a post lamp here, bringing light to the surrounding, but only covers a small part. It’s dark outside the park’s area, and I can only sit here at the park, where light can be seen, but of course there are lights coming from houses but not enough to brighten the surroundings.

    I’ve been sitting here for about 3 hours, after walking for 30 minutes, I rested here as I saw the park, because I find it as a good spot for my final rest…

    And it’s where my grave is going to be located.

    <p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
    I’m bored. There’s one hour left before the teleportation, and I’m sleepy. *yawn*

    I lie my body sidewards, occupying the rest of the bench’s space.

    I slowly close my eyes and relaxed my body.

    A dark and empty place can be seen.

    “So peaceful… I want to experience this again…”

    This is a dark place anyone would seek, a dark place where you can feel at ease.

    I closed my eyes and slept peacefully again.

    <p style="text-align: center;">***</p>

    “Uhhh… What?!”

    A white room, a blackboard, chairs, students, and a teacher. I hold my head for a second as soon as I saw these things.

    “Summer class…” I mutter.

    I placed my hand on my chest, my heart is beating violently, it hurts. I look around once again, the same thing can be seen again. After that, my eyes became fixated on one person…

    Mr. Awful.

    He smiled and looked at me.

    *inhale* *exhale*

    I finally calmed down, and I didn’t notice, the class was in chaos without me noticing, I’m too nervous to notice it.

    “Where am I? Hey you! Where am I?” a girl suddenly asks Mr. A.

    “You’re in a classroom, can’t you see that?”, Mr. A replied.

    “You call this white room a classroom? Hahahaha.”. She laughs as soon as she heard that.

    “Yes, there is a blackboard right here beside me, and here, a chalk, and those chairs, don’t you think this is a proper classroom?”

    “Then can you at least tell me why there are no windows?”

    “Do you want to know?”

    “Just tell me.”

    “So people won’t see your crazy reactions, that’s the reason.”

    “Crazy reactions?”. Everyone looks confused as they heard that.

    “Yes, like shouting, crying and screaming.”

    “Why would that even happen?”

    “That’s the point of this classroom.”

    “You’re lying.”

    “It’s the truth.” I said.

    “Hohohoho…” Mr. A look at me as he said this.

    “What do you mean it’s the truth?”, The girl asked me.

    “It is the truth, for some reason, I kind of knew what this place is.”, I answered.

    “Then you know who he is? And what is this place?”

    “Yeah, I guess.”

    She stood up… Then she slowly walks towards me. She stopped at the front of my table.

    “What?”

    “You look good.”

    “Thanks.”

    Her face suddenly got close to me, really, really close.

    “Hey what are y-“

    “Are you an accomplice?” She whispered to me.

    “Huh?”. An accomplice?

    “I’m asking you if you’re an accomplice of him.”

    “N… No…” I replied.

    “I see.”

    She then raised her face then go back to her seat. Am I that suspicious for her to suddenly ask me like if I was an accomplice.

    “…”

    “So, you guys are done with your sweet talk?” Mr. A asked.

    “It’s not of your concern.” The girl replied.

    “Well, that’s true, but this is a classroom, you’re not supposed to talk with each other when there is a teacher on front.”

    “We will be careful next time.”

    “Good.”

    I look around once again, I didn’t know this beforehand, but there are only 8 students here, including me. It was fewer than I expected, maybe it was the same for Jack? Where is he now though? I just hope my plan succeeds.

    “Can you explain it now? The reason why we are here?” A guy beside me asked.

    “Okay… Welcome to Summer Class! students. As you already know, it is summer right? Sad to say but you are going to have another class in this summer.”

    “EHHH?!?!?! A summer class?”. Voiced by a surprised girl that is in front of me.

    “Yes, a summer class. You can’t get out of this classroom without completing my test first, you are supposed to complete my test before going out, that’s the rule. Also, there are three other tests you need going to complete, after that the summer class will be over. My test is the first test for the Summer Class. Oh, sorry, I’m Mr. Awful, the teacher for this test, you students are going to take my test today. Goodluck!”

    He said the same thing, looks like he will use the car accident torture for this test, like he did to Jack’s class. But it doesn’t seem like he will explain the test any further, and the consequences.

    “A test… I’m lazy to do any of that.” A guy that is on my right said.

    “Don’t be like that, Spark.”, Mr. A replied.

    “Eh? You know me?”

    “Of course, I am your teacher.”

    “But I don’t know you, how is that possible, I never heard of a teacher named Awful before.”

    “You’re going to learn more about me after this test. You students only need to pass first test, and that’s it, you can get out here. But remember, there are three another tests.”

    “Okay… I see.”

    “I guess we should start the test now, as early as possible. Are you students ready?”

    Everyone nodded, except me.

    *inhale*

    “WAHHHHHHH!!! IT’S NOT REAL, THE CAR ACCIDENT, THE PAIN, ALL OF THAT ARE FAKE. IT’S FAKE, IT’S FAKE, IT’S FAKE. Hah… Hah…” I shouted.

    Everyone was surprised to my sudden shouting, and everyone started looking at me. Confused at why I am shouting, most of them laughed.

    *laugh* *laugh* *laugh*

    The only person that didn’t laugh at me, was the girl who whispered at me… It would be nice if she somehow believed my sudden shouting, even one, even just one person.

    “Well enough of that, let’s start the test, shall we? We are going alphabetically, I’m going to start with Sandro, are you ready Sandro?” Mr. A asked.

    “Yes, let’s do this.” Sandro replied.

    “I will just place my palm in your head and… Done.”

    Sandro suddenly coughs, he only coughs. Surprisingly without any other reactions, that’s odd, he was that strong enough to withstand the accident?

    “Oh??? Looks like the test was too easy for you huh?”

    “Easy?”

    Wow, just how strong this guy is? I mean, he didn’t shout or anything like that.

    “That’s a weird test, is that occurrence really the test?”. He asked.

    “Yes, the fact that you are able to come back here at this classroom, is a proof that you passed the test.”

    “I see.”

    Did he believed what I said? Nah, he laughed at me earlier, that shouldn’t be the case.

    “Interesting. Let’s proceed to the next one. Salia are you ready?”

    “Ehhh? That’s the test? What was that?” Salia replied.

    “Don’t get impatient, you will be going through the same thing.”

    “Okay…”

    “Here I go.”

    Mr. A then raised his palm and placed it on Salia’s head…

    “AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! *coughs* IT HUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURTS! *coughs* *coughs* *coughs*”, Salia screams as she clutched her chest from the pain.

    It’s here, the familiar scream I recognized from Jack’s Test A. The rest of the class was surprised from the sudden scream by Salia, even me, who already know what’s going to happen was surprised. Given the sudden loud scream from a quiet classroom, anyone would be surprised on a sudden loud screaming.

    “Hey, what did you just do?” a girl at the right of Salia asked.

    “It’s a test, didn’t I already say it?”

    “What did you do specifically?”

    “I played a movie inside her head.”

    “A movie?”

    “A movie.”

    “How could a movie possibly make someone screams in pain like that?

    “It’s not a third-person movie, but a first-person movie.”

    “A first person? You mean we are the protagonists?”

    “Yes.”

    “So, it felt real enough to make someone screams like that?”

    “Yes.”

    “You’re kidding right?”

    “Not really.”

    She sighed.

    “This is unbelievable.” She said while shaking her head left to right repeatedly.

    That’s what I think too, everything about this was unbelievable, how could someone possibly have the power to do this kind of thing. It’s a supernatural power that shouldn’t exist at all, but I can’t help but believe this is the truth, after experiencing this teleportation myself.

    “Yeah, I think so too.” I said.

    “Yeah, so, Mr. A, do you think I could run right now?”, She said.

    “Run you said?”

    “Yes, Run.”

    “That’s impossible, I already told you students that you need to pass the test first, otherwise you can’t get out here.”

    “Really?”

    She suddenly dashed to the door.

    “And… YAH!”, and she charged at the door. But…

    “OUCH!, What’s with this door? It’s so hard.” She stopped while standing at the front of the door. Pausing like a statue, she gathered her breath.

    Everyone was puzzled from her sudden paused, standing like a statue at the front of the door, not saying anything, and not moving.

    After a minute of standing, she finally said something.

    “Okay! I give up, there’s no way out in here.”. With a defeated sigh, she returned to her seat.

    “I’m glad you understand.” Mr. A said.

    Was she looking for a way outside? Because that’s what she sounds like, but she was just standing at the front of the door though.

    “Were you not just delaying your time because it’s your turn now?” the guy on my left side asked.

    “You’re not smart enough to understand what I did, sorry to say that.”

    “No, from my perspective you’re weak, not even a one smart person properties can be seen from you.”

    “Yeah, that’s right I’m weak, but you’re dumb.”

    “You sure about that?”

    “A hundred percent sure about that.”

    “Not sure why I am dumb, but you are pretty dumb yourself, weren’t you charging at the door earlier thinking you could break it?”

    “Not really, hahaha.”, She chuckled. “That’s far from my objective, sorry.”, She continued.

    “HAHAHA, of course, the reason why you did that is to look for an exit.”

    “Maybe?”

    “Stop playing dumb. Hey Mr. Awful.”, He called out Mr. A.

    “Yes?” Mr. A replied.

    “Is there a punishment here?”

    “Yes, of course.”

    “Do you think you can punish her by making the test harder? Wouldn't that be interesting? She stood up while the class was still ongoing. There should be a price for that, right?”

    What a surprising suggestion… But I wouldn’t even recommend it.

    “Hmmm, I’m planning to use this for later, but I could try it right now.”

    Planning to use? Is he actually hiding something?

    "Hey Hey HEY! What do you think you're doing?" she asked, confused as to why he suggested something like that.

    “Asking for a punishment for you, are you deaf?”

    “Hey Mr. A don’t you think this is unfair, both of us should be punished right?”

    “Hey! Shut up!”

    “You are the one who should shut up!”

    “Calm down both of you, I should add a little twist for your test today, that would be alright right?” Mr. A said.

    “Hey Mr. A can’t you just let this pass? I will not charge at the door again.”

    “Mr. A I didn’t do anything bad right? Why am I included?”

    “Stop acting innocent, both of us are talking while there are still class.”

    “But, that’s a small thing compare to what she did, right Mr. A?

    “No, both of you are going to be punished.”

    “That’s not fair!” He stood up and shout at Mr. A.

    “Hey, don’t raise your voice to a teacher.”

    “SHUT UP! YOU SCAREDY CAT!”

    “Well… Goodluck.” She said then looked away.

    “Go back to your sit, Seth” Mr. A gently said.

    “I will NOOOOOT!” he strongly rejected Mr. A.

    “Oh well, let’s just start the test, with a twist. I will let this slide this time Seiko, don’t do that again.”

    “Yes Mr. A, I understand.” Seiko replied.

    “HEY! WAIT! What about her punishment?”

    “Sorry, you’re not getting any good sleep.”

    “What do you mean? HEY!”

    Mr. A leaned in close, placing his face beside the guy's. He whispered, "Listen carefully. In the movie, you're going to be hit by a car. If that happens, you can't come back to this classroom, and you will be killed. You won't be able to return home either. So, do your best to not get killed.”

    "HEY WHA-" He stopped midway as Mr. A placed his palm above the guy's head.

    Suddenly, he fell to the floor.

    “HEY! What happened?”

    What just happened?!!!

    I immediately tried to go to him, his body faced downwards along with his face. When I turned him upwards…

    “WHAT?!”

    His eyes… both of his eyes were black, no, they were empty.

    “Goodness… Is he dead?” I asked Mr. A.

    “Sadly, yes. It looks like he can’t handle such twist, ahahahahaha.”

    His face, it looks terrifying, a total nightmare. I didn’t expect that a person with empty eyes could be this terrifying, both of his eyes are wide open, but empty inside…

    I will not forget this sight. I’m sorry, I couldn’t save you.

    I stood up while holding his body and slowly laid it in the corner of the classroom.

    “Sorry about that, I should have explained this thing more properly…” I said while looking at his soulless body.

    Everyone was looking away from his body. It looks like they don't care about him, or maybe they just don't want to anger Mr. A and experience the same thing as him.

    This monster.

    “Hey Mr. A.”

    “Yes?”

    “Do you plan on using that twist again?”

    “Yes.”

    “For how many times?”

    “I only planned to use this once, but as you can see, there is a nuisance here. I will use it one more, on the student I really planned to use it for.”

    “That couldn’t be possible me, right?”

    “It’s you.”

    “You plan to use that twist on your accomplice? Sounds like a dumb plan.” A girl who whispered to me earlier said.

    “I already told you I’m not an accomplice of Mr. A.”

    “Sure, that’s what you said, but I will not believe that easily.”

    “Suit yourself.”

    What’s wrong with her?

    Anyways, I should use this opportunity to experience the test myself. I need to be strong enough to face this test head on, or else I will die early.

    “Hey Mr. A, can I start the test early?” I asked.

    “Yes you can.”

    “Thanks.”

    “What are you planning to do?”

    I ignored his question and proceeded to go back to my seat.

    “Let’s do this… Mr. Awful.”

    Mr. A approached me and placed his palm on my head.

    *inhale* *exhale*

    I’m ready to face you, Mr. A.

    “Enjoy the movie, Sky.”
