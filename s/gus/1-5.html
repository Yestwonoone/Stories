  <div id="story"><p></p>
    Another day in the summer vacation, it is the fifth day, things are still the same, I myself are the only person on this house. Today is Friday, the day where me and my friends go to Jack’s house. I open up my smartphone and go to contacts.

    “Hmmm? Who are these people?”
    
    CONTACTS:
    -	Ace
    -	Caddie
    -	Cadmus
    -	Caleb
    -	Callan
    -	Dawn
    -	Jack
    -	Jae
    -	Regs
    
    “Who are these people? I don’t know any of them except for Jack, and my parents which are Jae and Regs.” Oh, Friday is the day where me and my friends will go to Jack’s house, but the problem is, I don’t know who are these friends I’m talking about.
    
    “Ace, Caddie, Cadmus, Caleb, Callan and Dawn are they my friends?” I have no idea, I do remember having my friends in the contacts, they are the only people I would insert in my contacts, plus my parents Jae and Regs. Still, like yesterday I don’t remember these people, most likely they are the friends that I am talking about. We usually go to Jack’s house when it is Friday, but now it’s impossible, I don’t even remember them. I should go to Jack’s house by myself and ask him about this.
    
    “Jack, I’m going there right now, I’m going to ask something.” I messaged him.
    
    “Okay got it, see you later.” he responded.
    
    I then prepare myself to take a bath. I can’t believe how confused I am right now, not even a mathematics problem made me this confused before.
    
    “And here I thought summer is going to be relaxing, ahhh… I’m disappointed of you summer, you’ve let me down.” I said while walking towards the bathroom.
    
    ***
    
    “Jack? I’m here.” I called him.
    
    “Welcome, come sit here.” he greeted me.
    
    “Sure” I replied.
    
    I started heading towards the chair, Jack also sat on the chair. After I sat on the chair, I immediately ask him about the things that bothered me since yesterday morning. That’s my plan from the start.
    
    “Something’s bothering me since yesterday, also today, can you listen to me? I also intended to ask you some questions, are you okay with that?” I asked him. He nodded so I started telling him about the thing that bothers me yesterday, as clearly as possible.
    
    “So, you noticed that something is wrong right?” he asked me.
    
    “Yeah, after waking up, I noticed I’m the only one at the house, and what’s more surprising, someone already cooked a rice. I still haven’t cook rice and it is strange that there is a cooked rice in the kitchen, I think someone cooked it in the morning, and I couldn’t have done that since I woke up 10 o’clock in the morning yesterday. I’m also pretty sure I didn’t wake up early yesterday and cooked it up myself, since it was already 2 o’clock in the morning when I sleep, I shouldn’t have the strength to wake up early, so someone else must have cooked it.”
    
    “That’s a one interesting story you got there. I’m pretty sure you’re not lying, as you said earlier you couldn’t have survived those 4 years without someone’s help, and your mother and father is working far away from our place. Could it be that they send you monthly some money for your daily expenses? And you just forgot that’s how you live? I personally don’t know what is your situation on your house so I’m not pretty sure.”
    
    “You are right about how they send me some money, but they don’t send it for my daily expenses but they send it as my expenses for school and to save it, it means I couldn’t have used those money for buying ingredients, and for paying bills, it’s a money intended for me to save for future. Maybe someone older than me in the house also got money to buy for our daily expenses, so I think, we use the same money for different purposes. Besides I can’t cook, there’s no way I could just rely on buying canned foods for all those 4 years, but I can’t remember someone cooking on my house, and I’m pretty sure I don’t cook myself. Isn’t that weird?”
    
    “Yeah, totally weird. You said you only noticed it, yesterday right?”
    
    “I’m not quite sure about the other day, but I only noticed it yesterday.”
    
    “I see, how about your problem today? Maybe they are connected somehow, tell me about it.”
    
    I told him about the thing that bothered me today, about how there are unfamiliar names in my contacts, and how I forgot my friends who are also supposed to go on his house today. After telling him, I also ask him a question.
    
    “Am I the only one who go here every Friday”, I asked.
    
    “Yes, you are the only one.”
    
    “Are you sure about that? There are no people who go here besides me?”
    
    “I’m sure, I don’t remember anyone, you said our friends are supposed to come here including you, but I don’t remember them at all.”
    
    So, both of us can’t remember them, but unlike him I can remember that I have friends, while Jack can’t remember our friends at all, how sad.
    
    “So, you don’t remember that there are other people who comes here besides me, is that right?”
    
    “Yes, but let’s pretend for now, supposedly I have or we have this ‘friends’, right? And for some reason we can’t remember them. I don’t remember them being my ‘friends’ but you, Sky, remembered that they are our ‘friends’, it’s just you can’t remember their name, face and everything except for the fact that they are our ‘friends’.”
    
    “Yes, you got it, that’s the story.” I answered.
    
    “You said you only noticed it, today right? While the problem about your house, you only noticed it yesterday. Are you sure that you only forgot our ‘friends’ today? Are you sure that they didn’t happen on the other days?” he asked.
    
    “No, I’m not sure, the only reason why I’ve noticed it today is because I remembered that today is Friday and our ‘friends’ and I supposed to come here on your house. So, it is quite possible that maybe I’ve forgotten them on the other day not just today.”
    
    “Okay, so you didn’t remember their name and faces right? Maybe you can find their names in your contacts? I think I inserted our ‘friends’ number in my contacts, check yours.”
    
    “I forgot to say, I already checked my contacts earlier this morning when I was about to message you, there are lots of unfamiliar name on it, maybe they are our ‘friends’.”
    
    “Maybe that’s the case. How about we check if we have the same name in our contacts? If you can’t and I can’t remember this name that is included in our contacts, maybe they are our friends? You said there are lots of unfamiliar names in your contacts, then I will also try and look for unfamiliar names in my contacts and see if they have the same name.” he suggested.
    
    After looking through the contacts again, I listed the unfamiliar names I found in my contacts in the notes in my smartphone:
    -	Ace
    -	Caddie
    -	Cadmus
    -	Caleb
    -	Callan
    -	Dawn
    
    “Hey Jack, you done listing the unfamiliar names?”
    
    “Yes, there are 5 of them.” he answered.
    
    Jack then showed me the list of unfamiliar names he found in his contacts:
    -	Ace
    -	Caddie
    -	Cadmus
    -	Caleb
    -	Callan
    
    After reading it, I noticed that they are the same, the unfamiliar names shown in the list are the same, except for my list who have 6 names, the only name that doesn’t have similarities is ‘Dawn’.
    
    “Wow, they are the same? But I noticed on my list there is another name which is ‘Dawn’, you don’t have this name on your list, maybe ‘Dawn’ is not our friend, since ‘Dawn’ only appeared in my contacts and not yours. Still, to think that we have the same list of names except for ‘Dawn’, that’s unbelievable, I think it’s safe to say that they are our ‘friends’?”
    
    “You’re right, that’s unbelievable to think that they would be the same. I think they are the names of our ‘friends’. The name ‘Dawn’ only appeared on you right?” I nodded. “Then, how about we pretend ‘Dawn’ is the missing person in your house?” My eyes widen as I heard this. “You said from yesterday you think that there is someone living with you that you can’t remember, and today you said you can’t remember our ‘friends’. Since we already excluded our ‘friends’ names in the list, and the only name in your contacts that still remain unfamiliar which is the name ‘Dawn’, I think ‘Dawn’ is the missing person that you can’t remember yesterday.”
    
    If I take Jack’s idea as a key in this problem, that would be a great step in understanding this mystery about us forgetting our friends, and me forgetting my family member. His idea makes sense if you think about it, take it is a process of elimination, if we eliminate our ‘friends’ names in the list, then the remainder would be my family member, which name is ‘Dawn’. That should clear the problems of the names and the uneasiness of not knowing who was forgotten.
    
    "I think they also disappeared."
    
    "What do you mean?" he asked.
    
    "I did say that there is no person in our house yesterday, the house is locked inside, it's like 'Dawn' teleported somewhere." That’s how I looked at it, plus the spoon on the floor, it’s like ‘Dawn’ was holding it before the teleportation. That’s unlikely to happen in reality, really.
    
    "How about we give our 'friends' a call to confirm it?" Jack suggested.
    
    He and I started calling them one by one.
    
    *beep* *beep* *beep*
    
    Unfortunately, the call is always being cut. Maybe their phone is turned off, we can't get through them, so we have no way of knowing what happened to them.
    
    "It's no use, we can’t get through them, I also tried calling 'Dawn', it is the same." I replied.
    
    "I see, then we can't do something about it. How about our classmates? We should try and ask our classmates about them, if they remember them."
    
    I tried asking my classmates through online, in social media, but all of them said they didn't know any of the 'friends' names. So, they are really forgotten, my classmates, Jack and I didn't even know why, before I knew it they are already forgotten.
    
    "No luck, they don't know." He said.
    
    "Me too, they are totally forgotten for some reason, we don't know the cause. It's really a bad prank, how is that even possible? Maybe this is a dream, can you pinch my arm? If this is reality I should be able to feel pain, like we see in the movies."
    
    I got pinched really hard in the arm, and it really hurts. "Ouch!" I shouted while holding my arm. It's still really unbelievable, this is not normal at all, and I don't even know if I or Jack too would be forgotten. What if we were forgotten? What if no one remember us? Will we be able to escape? Are we going to be saved? Why is this happening? I have no idea, I really have no idea what in the world is happening. There's no way I can just accept this reality that easily, but if it was indeed reality, is there a way we can prevent this from destroying our daily lives any further? Can I, only a student end this?
    
    "Ughhh... My head hurts from thinking this confusing stuff. I should rest for today. Jack I should get going now. Thanks for accompanying me with this unbelievable story, you helped me a lot, thanks." I said.
    
    "No problem, we don't know what's going to happen anytime now, I'm glad I could help you. Message me anytime if you have questions, take care."
    
    "Yeah, thanks, see you again."
    
    I then walk away from Jack's house, 5 minutes, walk it is, until I reach the motorcycle area.
    
    "I want to sleep so badly right now", I said in a low voice.
    
    I can't help but feel that way, considering how this day went, this is an extreme summer I must say, totally unbelievable when it was only 5th day in the summer vacation. Not the kind of summer I expected, I thought it would be a relaxing summer vacation as any other summer vacation the past, but I was proven wrong, this is the worst summer vacation I've ever experienced and it's just getting started.
    
    "This is really a hopeless summer vacation." I sighed.
