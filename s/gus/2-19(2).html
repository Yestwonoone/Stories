    “…Hmmm…”

    I’m currently walking on the side of the road.

    I have no idea why I am walking right now at the first place.

    “I see...”

    I almost forgot, I’m inside the Test A, and supposedly a car accident should occur anytime now.

    I’m not dumb enough to let myself be unprotected when I knew what’s going to happen anytime now. That’s why I should…

    “Hide on a place where there are no nearby roads.”

    I decided to look around for the place where I can hide. I should move fast, or else I will die sooner than I imagined.

    “This place… This is Victo? What?”

    Victo is the place where I currently lives, and for some reason I am back here…

    If this is the same place, then finding a place to hide should be easy. I should hide inside the school premise, it is the nearest place I could think of right now.

    Luckily, this place is not a city, so there won't be a long traffic of vehicles passing by. Therefore, it is the best place to avoid car accidents.

    I decided to run as fast as I can, to my destination, the school.

    After 3 minutes of running.

    *pant* *pant* *pant*

    I finally arrived.

    “I’m back… Excuse me… Sorry for going inside without me asking for permission…”

    For some reason the gate is open, and I easily got inside.

    “Excuse me…”

    Looks like someone is inside the school, since the gate is open. Someone must have open it earlier.

    I walked slowly while looking around, avoiding making much noise.

    “No people around here, lucky.”

    Luckily, I couldn’t find any people around here, so the person who unlocked the gate is nowhere to be found, and I will be able to enter without any problem. But that’s not the problem now, I should hide somewhere.

    “…What’s that noise?”

    It’s getting closer… Closer… And closer…

    “It’s…”

    Closer and closer, it’s getting closer really fast!

    “IT’S HERE! HEY HEY HEY! MY GOODNESS! OHHHHHHH!”

    I ran as fast as I can to one of the classrooms, without thinking that much I ran towards a broken door.

    I got inside the classroom, and I closed the door.

    *loud crash*

    “OHHH!”. I curled my body and protected my head with both of my hands.

    I didn’t feel any impact from the crash, but it was loud enough for me to knew what just happened.

    *breathes heavily*

    “That was scary…”

    This is my first time experiencing such an extreme situation, where I could die at any moment. It's even scarier than I thought. 

    I'm glad I found a safe place to hide. I don't think a car could possibly get inside here after crashing, as there is a wall and many classrooms. Unless Test A is about an airplane accident instead of a car accident, I could be in danger wherever I go.

    I don't know any underground places to protect myself from an airplane accident, but since Test A is about a car accident, it would be hard for cars to crash through the walls and reach me. So, I should be safe in here.

    I’m still lying on the floor trying to rest from the sudden shock.

    “What to… do… Oh, there is a car accident, then there should be a victim on the area. In the first place how did that car crashed here since it doesn’t make any sense for a car to suddenly crash inside the school premise. Maybe a problem on the car itself? But, the speed, the speed of the car, it felt like it was intentional.”

    There are houses around the school, and the road can only handle one car. If that’s the case, the driver should drive slowly around here. But, for some reason this car drives fast, like it was intentional…

    This is a test, and maybe that’s the point? There is no common sense, but only out-of-this-world things. 

    I should check out what happened to the car.

    “Hoh……”

    The front of the car can be seen, and a hole has been created in the wall. It looks like the car is fast and strong enough to destroy the school's surrounding wall. The wall isn't that high, maybe about the height of two persons combined, yet the car managed to destroy it.

    “A car with a mouth, hahaha.”, I chuckled.

    The front of the car was completely destroyed, resembling a mouth, which looked quite funny to look at. Debris from the wall is scattered around and above the car, creating a messy scene.

    “Oh, I forgot! What about the victims…”

    I looked inside, and found nothing, there are no people inside the car.

    “…”

    For real?

    “…Just what is this nonsense…”

    There is no driver, there are no people… Only the car, an empty car. This car drives and crashes itself into the wall at high speed, without a driver. Maybe a ghost rode it, that's why I can't see him/her.

    It’s a first time for me to experience an extreme situation, and I’m having a hard time trying to believe these happenings. It’s just everything about the tests is too mysterious…

    As Mr. Awful said, this is a test that only occurs in the student’s mind. Then, this is not a real world.

    If this is a world created by Mr. A, then everything could happen. A ghost could appear on this world because this is an imaginary world. That’s why a car without a driver, is real, it exists. It’s not strange to have those things in this world, because this is an imaginary world.

    Ridiculous.

    Absolutely ridiculous… There's nothing left for me to do here. I already know who the enemy is. I should stay hidden because I don't know if there will be a second wave.

    I returned to the same classroom once again, taking a seat on one of the chairs and trying to relax.

    “What to do now…”

    I checked my pockets, and I felt something.

    “Smartphone… and a 50 P cash…”

    I opened my smartphone, and looked for the time, the time is currently 12:15. It is afternoon, and it is hot.

    “I’m getting hungry…”

    I only have 50 P cash in here, and I have no idea for how many days I will remain in here. I planned on completing this without me getting in an accident, but I don’t know if it is possible, and with me only having 50 P it is impossible to live here with just that amount of money.

    The purpose of the test is to get us in an accident, to let us experience how does it feel to get hit by a car, and I don’t know the point of this test, it’s just a torture. It means to complete the test, I need to get myself hit by a car, which is the thing I want to avoid. I want to try if I can complete the test without me dying, and that’s what I’m trying to do right now.

    But as always, I noticed something strange about this. Almost, no, all of the students I’ve heard or saw taking the test, all of them died. I don’t know for how long each of their tests lasts, but for Jack, he said the test only lasts for 3 minutes. It means, he died, and only experienced 3 minutes on this world.

    Which is strange, I mean, think like this… If you knew beforehand you’re getting hit by a car, it is only natural that you will try everything just to protect yourself, and that’s why it is strange why Jack died and only lived for 3 minutes in here.

    Maybe I’m wrong on this one, because Jack didn’t actually know beforehand that the test is about car accident. But I wonder if there’s at least one person who managed to escape this car like I did?

    I suddenly felt the emptiness within my stomach, and it hurts.

    “I wonder if there are foods over here?”

    I went outside of the classroom. Right now, my destination is the store, I want to buy a snack.

    Instead of walking, I ran as fast as I can. I need to buy fast, since I have no idea when or if there will be a second wave of the car accident.

    There is a big store, located 2 minutes away from the school, that’s where I am going to buy my snacks for this day.

    Once I’ve arrived, I noticed something.

    “It’s closed?”

    The store is closed. I tried looking for the others stores that is nearby. Closed. Closed. Closed. Closed. Closed. All of them are closed.

    “Now, what to do… But really, what is this…”

    I couldn’t find people, I didn’t find any people as I looked for stores, they are nowhere to be found.

    “Did Mr. A. also remove people other than me?” *sigh*

    If that’s the case, I should try going in on other people’s house. That shouldn’t be a crime, right?

    In this world, no one lives on these houses, then it should be alright if I take a peek inside, right?

    Although I said that, shouldn't there be a lock on the house? Then, I can't go inside...

    Nah, let's try nonetheless.

    I picked one of the houses that is in front of me, after closing in, I tried opening the door… And for some reason, without difficulty, with no trouble at all, without me sweating from trying to break in on someone’s house, I somewhat effortlessly opened the door without any problems.

    “Well, well, well… I didn't know I had such skills to be a pro burglar. I should debut myself as a burglary star when I get back, haha.”

    Without wasting much time, I tried looking for some foods inside the house. All the doors can be open easily without any problems… But, at the end I didn’t find any food at all.

    “Now that’s sad… Now to the next one!”

    I tried getting in on another house, multiple of them, but there is still no luck, I couldn’t find any foods at all. When I tried going in on some store, which is surprisingly there are also no locks attached to it, I got in easily… But as I expected, the store itself is empty, there are no foods and items.

    “To think my 50 P cash would be this useless on this world.”

    Money is useless on this world, there’s nothing to buy after all. Without any foods to spend on, all I can do now is to let myself starved inside the classroom…

    Instead of trying to successfully complete the test, looks like my goal now is to survive as long as I can without eating and drinking.

    “Haha… Really now, that’s some cruel torture you got there, Summer.”

    Once again, I ran, ran, ran, and finally arrived at the same classroom. There are no signs of the second wave of car accident…Looks like he programmed this world to only support a few minutes experience, then it would make sense. If the student dies within a few minutes after arriving here, then there’s no need to place food in this world, if the student dies within few minutes after arriving here, then there’s no need for another wave of the car accident… Since the students will die after few minutes, then it should make sense why this world is like this, it can only support a few minutes experience.

    Now, since I successfully avoided the first wave, and managed to stay alive for an hour, then the second wave should be, the starvation to death. Well, with this world being programmed like this, then I would surely die of starvation, there’s no escape.

    Man... I don't know if I should just let myself die in a car accident, which happens quickly but inflicts intense pain due to the high speed, or starve to death, a slow and agonizing process. Both options cause harm, but the car accident would be a shorter burst of pain, while starving would mean enduring pain for a much longer period.

    If you ask people, if they would rather to die on a fast or slow way… They would surely pick the fast way, because normally, if you got killed, then you can’t feel the pain after that, since you already died. On the other hand, the slower way is much painful than the faster way, unlike the fast way, you are still alive and experiencing the pain slowly.

    One would choose to die instantly to avoid experiencing the pain, rather than torture, which kills you slowly while you are still alive and harms you mentally. Both leads to death, but the amount of pain is not the same.

    Then there’s this summer class, the Test A, which totally changes the rules of death. Now instead of not feeling the pain after the death, you can now still experience the pain after the car accident. Both car accident and starvation to death will be painful.

    It would be nice if I don’t get to feel the pain after getting hit by the car, but for some reason you can feel it even after dying. Now, I’m left with the with the second wave, which is the starvation to death.

    “This is cruel…”

    The time is currently 1:30.

    “I should sleep right now.”

    I don’t know why but if you sleep you can avoid feeling the starvation. That should let me escape from the problem for a short period of time…

    “I want to eat something…”

    I closed my eyes, while my stomach still hurts. I need to endure this and see if there will be something different tomorrow.

    I slept uncomfortably on the cold floor.

    <p style="text-align: center;">***</p>

    “…..”

    I opened my eyes, and I can’t see anything…

    “So dark… Where’s my smartphone…”

    I looked for my smartphone at this zero-visibility area, and luckily I immediately found it beside me. I opened my smartphone, and the brightness pierced my eyes…

    “Ahhh… Too bright…”

    I quickly reduced the brightness, or else my eyes would go blind. The time is already 8:30, and I was asleep for 7 hours straight.

    “My stomach hurts…”

    It’s back once again, my stomach hurts from being hungry since afternoon. I’m glad I was able to escape this stomach pain for seven hours. I probably wouldn’t be able to think straight when I’m experiencing being starve.

    Now thinking about it, it’s scary being here on school at night, it’s quiet and cold. Totally a place where ghosts might appear…

    “There’s no ghost right here, right?”

    I should find the switch for the lights…

    I opened my smartphone’s flashlight.

    “No ghosts… I’m glad…”. I released a sigh of relief.

    “Now, where’s the switch… Hmmm… Here.”

    The whole classroom brightened after I turn on the switch to the lights. Now that should reduce the creepiness of the school.

    I’m still hungry, and I can’t do something about it. Maybe I should sleep again, it’s not that I have something to do this night, all I can do is sleep if I want to endure this pain in my stomach. Yes, I should do that.

    With nothing left to do other than survive, once again, I dozed off on a cold floor.

    <hr><p style="text-align: center;">:Mr. Awful</p><p style="font-style: italic;">I was only planning on trying this twist on Sky, but I was forced to try it on Seth, he was being annoying…

    But I was surprised to see that he fainted… It looks like he can’t handle the twist.

    Since there is a low chance of dying from the first test, this is not enough to kill someone’s will to live, or Seth is just that weak of a person?

    That was too early Seth, didn’t know you’re that weak.

    When you stood up against me earlier, I thought you are strong willed, and that’s why I decided to test my experimental twist, which I only planned to test on Sky… You forced me to test it to you, but then, why did you die so quickly?

    What a let-down…

    This is the first time I’ve used this twist, and I’m surprised at the result.

    “Hey Mr. A.” Sky called me.

    Oh… What’s this? Is he finally challenging me?

    “Yes?”

    “Do you plan on using that twist again?”

    “Yes.”

    “For how many times?”

    “I only planned to use this once, but as you can see, there is a nuisance here. I will use it one more, on the student I really planned to use it for.”

    “That couldn’t be possible me, right?”

    So, he already expected it… That should make things interesting, but… Sadly he doesn’t have any idea what the twist is.

    “It’s you.”

    “You plan to use that twist on your accomplice? Sounds like a dumb plan.” Sora said.

    She was calling Sky an accomplice of mine? Hahaha. Is that how it looks like?

    “I already told you I’m not an accomplice of Mr. A.”

    “Sure, that’s what you said, but I will not believe that easily.”

    “Suit yourself.”

    Anyone would find it strange that only Sky has the knowledge about the summer class, that’s a natural response from the students, anyone would be cautious of him.

    “Hey Mr. A, can I start the test early?”

    “Yes you can.”

    “Thanks.”

    “What are you planning to do?”

    Did he just ignore me? Looks like he is being overconfident about this one.

    “Let’s do this… Mr. Awful.”

    “Enjoy the movie, Sky.”

    Happy trip, Sky…

    Sky fainted…</p>
    <hr>

    “…Hmmm…”

    I’m currently walking on the side of the road.

    I have no idea why I am walking right now at the first place.

    “Wait… WHAT?”

    What happened? Why I am outside? I was on the classroom… Wait, why I am walking here again on the side of the road? This is like what happened yesterday…

    Scratching my head, I don’t understand what just happened…

    But is this the second day or the first day? Did I loop or something?

    There’s no point on asking myself, like yesterday, I ran as fast as I can so I can hide from the car accident. If somewhat I looped, then the car accident should occur anytime now…

    *pant* *pant* *pant*

    “I’m here…….”

    I thought I was in the loop or something, but the hole is here, the same hole in the wall the car accident created. This must mean it isn’t a loop? But something is missing…

    “The car is missing, what is this…”

    The school gate is already open, and the wall is still destroyed, just like yesterday. The only strange thing is that the car is missing for some reason. Did someone move it while I was sleeping? There shouldn't be anyone here, and if they indeed moved it, maybe it would have been loud enough to wake me up. But, I didn't hear anything, and oddly enough, I was walking at the side of the road again. 

    I reached into my pocket for my smartphone and checked the time...

    “It’s 12:04, basically same time when I arrived here yesterday.”

    *noise*

    “…..”

    *noise*

    “Oh my God… IT’S HERE!”

    I sprinted for my life, desperate to find a safe hiding spot. I dashed back to the same classroom, thinking it would protect me. I immediately closed the door and huddled in a corner, trying to shield myself from whatever was out there.

    *noise*

    *loud noise*

    “…NO WAY!”

    *loud crash* *impact*

    “AHHH!”

    The deafening crash echoed through the walls, shaking me to my core. My heart pounded like a drum, it feels like it’s going to burst out of my chest.

    I clung to myself, trembling in terror…

    For some reason, the crash was even closer this time, the impact so intense that I could feel it within me.

    “I’m alive… hah… hah…” I said while breathing heavily.

    No injuries, I didn’t get hurt luckily. But that was terrifying, my heart hurts… I was so shocked, that was unexpected.

    “I’m lucky once again… Hah...”. I’m glad I got lucky, I’m really glad.

    I stretched and relaxed my body after knowing that the car stopped moving anymore.

    I repeatedly breathe, inhale and exhale, hoping my heartbeat will go back to its normal state.

    But honestly speaking, I don’t think I will be able to live for a few more days, especially with the need to deal with this crazy driverless car while I am currently starving to death. I got lucky today, but this luck will never last long…

    I kicked one of the chairs.

    This is beyond frustrating, it's pure torture. I'm getting so angry! If only I could figure out another way to beat this test without having to sacrifice myself, that would be incredible. But no matter how hard I try, I can't seem to find a way out, and that's what makes it all the more frustrating.

    I’m already helpless from the first test, how could I even believe that I have a chance to defeat Summer…

    But, the rule was already given, it’s that we need to be able to get back to the classroom without being soulless. It means that even if I died in a car accident, and I managed to get back, then it is my win…

    My stubborn self want to resist the rules, but this state of mine proves that I don’t have any powers to do any of that, and that my resistance is futile and doesn’t actually do something.

    There are still many things I don’t know, but there is one thing I know for sure right now… My real self is not going to die. In that case I can do whatever I want inside this world, without me worrying about my real self.

    “They wouldn’t kill my real body, right?”

    If Mr. A follows his rules, he wouldn't touch it, let alone kill it. And all of this happened in an instant, right? Then it would only feel like a second in the other world. So, my body should be safe, and there's no need to worry about it.

    *stomach growls*

    But it doesn’t change the fact that my stomach aches so much, it really hurts, much more compared to yesterday. And… I’m starting to get thirsty, my mouth my lips are too dried. Pushing more further, my head hurts too, it’s a headache, maybe from starving and lack of water…

    “This is too much…”

    It feels like a drill is drilling inside my head right now…

    I don’t think I should move any further, it will just exhaust me… 

    I was planning on going to the accident area, but I don’t feel like doing it now…

    I lie my body once again on the cold floor.

    I’m tired… So tired… I’m hungry… So hungry… I’m thirsty… So thirsty… I’m helpless once again…

    Without thinking much, I slept once again while feeling so weak.

    <p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
    “…Hmmm…”

    I’m currently walking on the side of the road.

    I have no idea why I am walking right now at the first place.

    “I’m here again…”

    The same starting place, the same time, but there is one thing different… It feels like there’s a hole in my stomach.

    This pain is unbearable, not that I know what it feels to have a hole in your stomach, but if I would explain how painful it is… It is really painful, and feels like I have a hole in my stomach…

    I ran once again, shouldering my stomach pain, along with the headache… With blazing hot summer being jerk as always, it feels like I’m about to die anytime now…

    “Hah… Hah…”

    I ran… Really really slow… Much slower than I expected, my body is not in the shape to run right now, but I need to move my body, or else I will get squashed by the car…

    My sluggish running can be seen, totally pathetic. I don’t think I’ve experience something like this in my whole life, I never have been into this kind of pathetic state.

    After 5 minutes of running, I finally reached the school once again. The hole from the first day is still here… When I got inside, I noticed another hole, this time from a classroom next to the one where I've been hiding… After today's accident, if I'm unlucky, the car could crash into my hidden classroom, putting an end to my life.

    *noise*

    “…It’s finally here…”

    I ran, I ran as fast as I can… Considering how bad my shape right now, I can’t run that fast… This car would catch up to me if I don’t find a new classroom where I can hide, and it should be near to me, or else the car would reach me before I can reach the classroom.

    There is a classroom that is nearby, but I think it is locked… I never actually tried this, but considering how the houses can be unlock, I think the classrooms works the same?

    I was focusing too much on sleeping and hiding from the same spot, and I didn’t even try to check if I can get inside the other classrooms…

    After reaching the door, I tried to open the door…

    “Oh… Hah… Hah… It can be open…”

    *noise*

    I immediately closed the door. The noise is getting closer and louder… I protected my head while lying on the floor…

    *loud noise*

    *heavy breathing*

    *loud crash* *strong impact*

    “AHHHH! My heart… hah… hah… What the…”

    I protected my head tightly, the impact was stronger, and the sound was louder… And my second hiding spot, has been discovered…

    The face of the car, is facing me, ready to kill me at any moment… But for some reason, it doesn’t have any power to move. Like from the other car accident, the car stops once it hits something… 

    That’s natural, it can’t possibly move if the insides of the car were broken, that’s how it should be…

    The classroom was busted… The front of the car can be seen, and it is in front of my eyes, looking at me.

    “A little more… And, it could have got me…”

    The classroom didn’t fall as the ceiling was still in contact… But the wall is, it was busted by the car… A terrifying situation…

    “But really… This car looks like he is peeping…”

    Considering how irregular this world is, I'm surprised the car stayed intact. I thought it would move like crazy even if it was already squashed to bits... But that's not the case; this is the third one, and that crazy movement hasn't happened even once.

    “Ahhhhh… Finally, today’s accident was done… I survived once again…”

    I’m happy but, someone, someone has been drilling the insides of my stomach for a while now, and it’s stronger than ever… I embraced my stomach, and pushing it, hoping I could reduce the pain…

    I’m getting tired.

    I’m getting sleepy.

    I stretched out my arms and my legs, and relaxed my body…

    “Please bear with me a little longer, my body, and my mind. I need your help…”

    I let out a big sigh…

    I closed my eyes…

    *noise*

    I opened my eyes… And looked on my right where the noise is coming from…

    “Huh…?”

    The car, it’s making noise… Don’t tell me…

    “This… is… totally ridiculous…”

    *loud noise*

    I tried to get up, but my body won’t move as I please.

    Perhaps I had relaxed myself too much… Ahahaha…

    “Ahahahaha…”

    I closed my ey-
