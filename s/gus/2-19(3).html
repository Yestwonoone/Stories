    “AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! MY HEAD AHHH! IT HURTS… THIS PAIN… AHHH!”. I screamed. 

    I scream while holding and pushing my head. I clench my fist and grit my teeth… 

    “It hurts, it really hurts… I don’t know what’s happening… AH!”

    *cough* *cough*

    “ARGHHH!”

    *cough*

    *inhale* *exhale*

    *cough* *cough*

    “It feels like… My brain is getting drilled… So intense…”

    I’m struggling to breathe properly… The pain is unbearable.

    “Hah… Hah… This is Test A? It’s crazy and so painful… Ouch…”

    I let out a small tear… The pain was unbearable, and I couldn’t help but to let out a tear…

    I continued to clutch my head, feeling the sting inside...

    So cruel… And so painful…

    "This headache is torture... I can't bear it any longer..."

    Taking a deep breath, trying to calm down.

    "Okay... I need to relax... I can't let this pain consume me..."

    Loosening the grip on my head, attempting to relax my body.

    "Focus... just focus on calming down... It's just a test, and I need to stay in control..."

    After resting for a bit, the pain in my head is gone... 

    …

    What could have happened in me?

    I didn't feel any pain on my whole body except for my head... 

    This is the pain of experiencing the car accident, and it seems the car must've hit me in the head... But I can't recall much of what happened to me.

    If only my head hurts, does that mean my head was smashed by the car? Could my brain have been squashed to bits?

    "...Man..."

    I suddenly remembered the car accident videos I've watch, there is one video where the victim got his brain smashed to bits... Maybe, that's what happened to me too... Terrifying…

    Oh?

    I'm too focused on screaming that I didn't notice where I am…

    The room is white as always, but there is something different, it's not a classroom.

    I looked around and the room is big, I think it is twice the size of the classroom, and it was just all white. Without any furniture and design, the room is totally just white, nothing else. After looking around more, I found something disturbing...

    There are three body of students lying on the floor...

    *gulp*

    "What in the world is this?" I asked myself.

    A disturbing sight of three bodies lay before me. I hesitated but eventually approached them...

    They all looked lifeless.

    Their eyes were empty, pure blackness, and there was no sign of breath escaping their lips. Three souls lost... One girl and two boys, all of them lifeless, from what I could see...

    I sat down, placing my palm on my face, and let out a heavy sigh... I needed a moment to clear my mind...

    Three students had fallen victim to the test. I couldn't imagine what kind of trials they endured... But one thing was certain, we all faced the same life-threatening challenge.

    I felt sadness for them, knowing firsthand just how hard and cruel the test could be...

    "Rest in peace my friends... I’ll fight Summer for you."

    That's all I can do... As a person who currently lives.

    I arranged their bodies more properly, lining them up, unlike before when they were scattered around as if someone had just thrown them into the room and left them like that.

    While doing so, I noticed something… A paper in the pocket of one of the girls. It was tucked away in her skirt's pocket...

    "Can I take a look?" I asked the person as if she was alive, so I can show some respect.

    I reached my hands for the paper...

    "Excuse me...". And I got it, it is a small piece of paper. I then tried to open it.

    "A message?"

    <p style="font-style: italic;">[ Please hold my hand and tell me to wake up. ]</p>
    I find it surprising to be able to read something like this… Is she supposed to be sleeping and hoping someone would wake her up?

    Hmmm… I don’t know it doesn’t sound good to touch someone’s body… 

    But they’re already dead…

    …

    "Don't worry I will hold it, if that's what you wanted."

    I raised her right arm, and it felt cold to the touch... This was the first time I had held someone else's hand.

    Gently, I placed my palm against hers, holding her hand.

    "Your hand is cold…”

    I need to wake her up, that's her last wish.

    "Hey, wake up! You need to wake-"

    Suddenly my head feels heavy.

    “Ah…?”

    My energy... is fading...

    I'm getting sleepy...

    I....................

    <p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
    Black... Everything is black... 

    I looked at my body. I can still see my body, my hands, and I can feel myself…

    So... What is this place...?

    I'm getting confused with this lot of unknown places I’ve been getting into.

    I remember waking up a girl that is soulless, and suddenly my consciousness fades away... And for some reason, I am on this incredibly dark place...

    I looked down, and I'm currently standing on a black platform. I don't know what this is, and where is this... I can’t see anything at the bottom… I looked up and it’s the same thing.

    "Hello? Anybody here?"

    Like someone could be possibly here, hah!

    Jokes aside... Is this another test?

    But I just finished the first test didn’t I?

    I don't know, I don't think I know, I have no idea at all, I am really clueless about this, I am completely ignorant on what this place actually is. In short, I don't know.

    I looked around... And I saw something white... Not really that far...

    "Maybe a clue?"

    I walked slowly. I'm being cautious, since I don't know what I am stepping at, it could be a void, and that would be scary.

    I'm slowly approaching to the white thing...

    It was a...

    "Person?"

    I walked a bit more, and I slowly getting closer... It is a girl, in her uniform, sitting in this black place.

    "Why are you here?" She asked.

    Woah! That was surprising…

    "Ah... I don't know…"

    "Then do you know where this is?"

    "Sorry, but I have no idea too..."

    She sighed.

    "You are inside of my mind."

    "Oh cool, wait... What?"

    "You are in my mind."

    "It means that you are thinking of me? Really?" I blushed.

    "Silly..." She said emotionlessly.

    "Just joking. So, this place is inside of your mind?"

    "Well, yeah."

    "You are already dead."

    "I guess..."

    "What happened to you? Didn't you have a test too?"

    "Yes, I also did the test like everyone else."

    "What test?"

    "Test A."

    "Test A? Really?"

    "Do you think I’m lying or what?"

    "Wow, are you expecting me to believe someone I barely know that easily?"

    “Well, you’re right about that.”

    "But then, are you saying you gave up?"

    "Gave up? I guess you could say that..."

    "Hmmm, is that so... So, what do you want me to do?"

    "What do you mean?"

    "Didn't you ask me to wake you up?"

    "I asked you? I didn't even know you.", She then turned around to look at me.

    "What? I'm Sky, you didn't know me?"

    "I don’t know who you are."

    I know… We both don’t know each other.

    "Then now you know me... How about you? Your name?"

    "Do I really need to?"

    "Why not?"

    "Eui."

    "Yui?"

    "E-U-I, Eui"

    Class E huh? Then she arrived first before me.

    "Okay... So, about the paper in your pocket... What is that about?"

    "Oh, that one? I just saw one of the students in my class fainting, so I thought maybe after the test I might faint too. That's why I wrote something on the paper to tell someone to wake me up..."

    "I see, it's still mysterious how I got in here, maybe you pulled me in..."

    "I don't know..."

    "Don't you want to live."

    "There's no reason to."

    "Do you really believe so?"

    "I've lost my family, living alone makes every day feel boring and dull... I don't have any friends, and this summer class, this test, it's pushing me to my limit. It's not that I really want to die... but, I feel like this might be the right time to end my monotonous life. If I don't do something soon, I'll just keep suffering. It's like a perfect opportunity, the right time – that's what this summer class feels like to me."

    "Man, you're so weak."

    "You know you didn’t have to tell me that one.”

    "Do you want a friend?"

    "If you are years earlier, I might think about it."

    "Even an old woman can get new friendship, or you’re telling me that it’s already too late?"

    She turned backwards and didn’t respond to my question.

    "I could be a friend of yours… I wouldn’t mind having a pretty friend…"

    "Really... I can't believe you."

    "Why not give me a chance? You can punch me if you believe I'm not worthy of being your friend..."

    "Why you're talking like I could get back to life?"

    "You can..."

    "How can you say that?"

    "Before I arrived on the summer class, I had a conclusion that, even if the student became soulless they can come back to life if they have the will to live..."

    "That sounds so fake."

    "What do you mean?"

    "How did you know about summer class beforehand?"

    I guess it wouldn’t hurt to talk about the story.

    "My friend Jack and I had a phone call while he was on the summer class, we had a phone call before he got teleported and for some reason the phone call works and didn't get terminated even in the other world. I heard many things from the phone call, like there is a classroom, a teacher, students, and the tests… But before it ends, Mr. Awful was aware that we are having a phone call, and because of that I challenged him. My plan is to find my friends, to complete the tests, and to defeat the mastermind of this summer class."

    "Hmmm… So, that's the story..."

    "Yes, don't you want to witness me defeat the mastermind? Wouldn't that be interesting to you?"

    "Why would I be interested from something like that?”

    "Don't be like that, I'm your friend, right?"

    "I didn't agree with being your friend yet."

    "Just accept me. And here I thought your life was boring, don't you want to struggle and at least try to fight back against the mastermind? Isn't that more exciting that spending your lifetime here? Man, talk about being a boring person."

    She turned around and glared at me.

    Am I being too harsh?

    “Hehe…”. I scratched my head and looked away.

    “I guess I could try…”

    "I knew you would do that.”. I chuckled.

    “That doesn’t change the fact that we are both stuck in here.”

    She’s right about that…

    Hmmm?

    "Hey."

    "What?"

    "What's happening with your right arm?", I asked her.

    "My right arm?". She then looks at her right arm.

    It's getting dissolve.

    "What's that? Hey are you okay?"

    "What's happening? My right arm is dissolving. But..."

    "But what?"

    "I don't feel any pain..."

    "There’s no pain?”

    Even though the first test can make you feel like it’s all real?

    "No pain at all. Now what to do... I might get dissolved, do you want that to happen?"

    Of course, I don’t want that to happen. But before I could say that, the dissolving suddenly stopped.

    "Hey it stopped."

    "You're right, only my right arm was dissolved for some unknown reason... Did you get scared?"

    "Why would I get scared? You are already a dead person. Do you believe you worth something more than a person who is currently alive and well?"

    "That’s way too harsh."

    "Sorry about that, but I was joking obviously. I got scared of course, because I don't have any idea why that happened. I can only guess something might’ve happened outside."

    But really, why only the right arm?

    "Now, do you want to get dissolved or wake up and become my friend?" I asked her.

    "Well, I guess I could help you with your games..."

    "I'm not playing games. You just can't be honest, you want me to save you right?"

    "Stop saying cringy things."

    "What did you say?"

    "I said you're cringy."

    Hearing someone says I’m cringe does hurt…

    "Still much better than you.”

    "Okay enough with that, now tell me what I need to do?"

    "Just say, 'I want to live’ repeatedly."

    "You sure that’s the way out?"

    “Then tell me something else.”

    “My bad, I’ll try it.”

    "Goodluck... Now I should get out..."

    "How will you do that?"

    "I don't know, I think you should kick me out."

    "Too troublesome, do your best..."

    "Really..."

    Now what to do? Should I shout 'I want to live' too?

    I have no any idea about this place, all I know is that you need the will to live in the first test… But this is not the first test at all… This is inside the mind of one of the students…

    I looked at her. “You know what to do.”

    I took a deep breath... inhale, exhale...

    "I WANT TO LIVE!"

    I collapsed...

    "Hey Sky! Hey! What happened? Sky?"

    ...falling asleep once again.

    <p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
    I opened my eyes... 

    I felt something on my right palm...

    The same white room can be seen...

    "Eui… Oh right! What about Eui?"

    I looked at my right hand. I was holding someone's hand. Yes, I'm holding Eui's right hand...

    But then, why is it that...

    ...I'm holding an amputated arm?
