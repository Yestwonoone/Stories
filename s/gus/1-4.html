    “Hmmm…”

    I stretched out my arms and my legs as I raise my body from my sleeping position, immediately after knowing I'm awake, I reached out my hands on my phone.
    
    “So hot… Oh it’s ten o’clock already, that’s why it’s hot.”
    
    I’m hungry.
    
    “I should grab some food.”
    
    I left my bed as it is and then went to the kitchen to prepare myself a hot chocolate drink, along with the drink I also grabbed some biscuits to satisfy my hunger this morning.
    
    “Weird,” I said. “do I live by myself? There’s no one here except me, I feel like someone here is missing, but who is it?”. Asking myself with this kind of question just confuses me, trying to escape from this question seemed to be a better way to start this really burning Thursday morning. “There’s no use thinking about it, let’s just eat.”
    
    I went to my bedroom and decided to eat and drink there, I placed the chocolate drink and the biscuits on a small table beside my bed, I started eating as soon after I sat on my bed. Playing games in my smartphone and watching anime is my way of killing some time. Oh right, I recently started reading some novels, I’m totally hooked now on reading it. 
    
    “Yummy, I’m full. Hot… Really what’s wrong with this summer vacation, torturing me this morning.”
    
    It’s summer vacation right now. It’s the only time when I can fully relax myself from the school activities, this two months of vacation should be my ally and shield against the enemy provided by the school. But to be honest, that’s just my selfish wish. There’s no way this summer is going to be my ally.
    
    “Look! You’re supposed to be my ally, yet you’re totally burning me with your heat, tone it down please.”
    
    Four days have passed since the summer vacation started, it’s indeed relaxing but something is missing, or someone? “So hot, and I just finished drinking the hot chocolate drink. Haha.” I laughed. “What I’m even doing? Drinking something hot during summer, that’s so… Cool, no it’s hot.” While realizing how cool, no dumb I am right now, I noticed something.
    
    “It’s quiet, I think it’s too quiet right now.”
    
    Come to think about it, this house feels like it is too quiet. I think there is another person who lives with me here on this house, or that’s what I felt. This house is too big for a one person, I think this is normally for two to three people, especially how there is another room besides mine with clothes and items I don't recognize. This room is full of clothes and items a girl uses, but I don’t know who, and why it is here. I’m the only one who live here on this house right now, it doesn’t make sense how there is these clothes and items I don’t even use, unless someone other than me lives on this house, then it would make sense. But, where is she? Does she even exist? I have no idea, with this house being like this I can’t help but think I’m not the only one who lives here.
    
    Empty. This house feels empty, I’m the only one here, and it’s quiet, too quiet. I do feel something is different. Unnatural? I guess, but since I don’t know the reason why it suddenly felt that way, I can’t shake off the feeling of being confused.
    
    It’s the same house I’ve been living for 4 years, there’s nothing wrong with it, but right now this house feels empty for some reason and I don’t even know why. I have no clue what’s happening right now, I’m confused. Maybe I’m overthinking things, yeah, that’s it, I’m just overthinking things. I’m just wasting time thinking about it.
    
    “I’m hungry from overthinking, eating lunch will revive me. I forgot, I should cook rice first, but cooking food…”
    
    I don’t know how to cook food. Frying is easy and I can manage that, but other than that I have no talent for cooking at all.
    
    “Did I just survive 4 years without knowing how to cook? That’s a rare talent I got there, but for real, how did I survive those 4 years?” I asked myself. “Oh… Canned foods, did I survive with just canned foods?” I added. No, that’s impossible, I don’t even work, I am a high school student without a job, not even a part-time job. With that it’s impossible to survive for 4 years without a job, and without knowing how to cook, I should be dead right now if that’s the case.
    
    I looked for some canned foods if there are some in the shelves, luckily, I found some, there’s a lot of them, I think it would suppress my hunger for 20 days. I shouldn’t have any food problems for a few weeks and rice shouldn’t be a problem too. After confirming this I immediately go to the kitchen to cook rice, but then, “What? Cooked rice?” I was surprised after seeing that there is a cooked rice in the kitchen, and yes, I don’t even remember cooking it. So, someone cooked it? That’s the easiest answer I can think of to my question. If it is the truth, then someone cooked the rice without me knowing it, it should be the time before I wake up, before 10 o’clock. Plus, there is a spoon on the floor, plus some rice attached to it. “What’s this? Did someone just leave their spoon on the floor… Why?” My goodness, I don’t get any of this.
    
    Confused from seeing this unknown scenery, once again I wondered. “I can’t think of someone else who would do that, it’s odd, did I forgot someone?”, I said while wondering. I know there’s no maid who could have done that, I don’t remember having a maid, I mean I can’t afford that kind of thing. Even if I have and somehow, she cooked the rice while I’m sleeping and then goes outside after that, it’s still impossible, because the door is locked in the inside.
    
    I laughed. “I guess the maid teleported, or there is a ghost maid who works on this house, that should explain this seemingly out of this world things.” Just kidding, there’s no way it could be true, there’s no maid in here and teleportation is just impossible.
    
    “Let’s just eat, I’m too hungry now, the hot chocolate drink and biscuits aren’t enough to satisfy my hunger. With all those overthinking I can’t help but get hungry.”
    
    I open up the canned sausage I found in the shelf, then I grabbed a plate together with spoon and fork. After getting rice and sausage I started walking to the living room, I decided to eat lunch here. I sit and place my plate on the table. Since it was too quiet, I opened up the television near me to break the silence, I picked a cartoon channel since shows from that channel are funny, and laughing would help me forget this uneasiness I felt this morning. While watching the television, I also eat, thanks to this I started loosening up myself a little bit.
    
    After I’ve eaten lunch, I cleaned up the mess and washed the dishes myself, I also turned off the television since I plan on spending my time on my room for the rest of the day. And then, I spend my whole day repeating the same thing.
