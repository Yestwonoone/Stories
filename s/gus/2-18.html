    Another morning, another morning welcomed by summer, the heat, the hotness can be felt throughout my whole body.

    “You’re hot as always, Summer.”

    Tomorrow’s the day. Even though it is tomorrow, I’m here, chilling inside the house, looking lazy. To think that I’m acting like this today, when in fact this is my last day to enjoy myself. The energy inside me is nowhere to be found, which is saddening. This situation is depressing, I can’t move like usual, I’m unusually low in spirits today.

    Well, that’s to be expected, there’s no point in entertaining myself any further. You can’t expect me to cheer up in this situation, this is cruel, I want to enjoy myself for the last time.

    To think that these normal days are coming to an end, these boring days, are coming to an end.

    End. Is rapidly approaching, faster than I could have imagine.

    I’m disappearing tomorrow…

    Well then, I should buy that one ice cream I haven’t eaten yet.

    There is this one ice cream that has been appearing five years ago up until now in the television commercials, I haven’t tried it yet. It looks yummy and was kind of expensive compared to the other ice cream. I guess this is the best time to buy some. Looks like I still have energy remaining in me to move, I’m not actually dead yet, luckily.

    “Ice cream as a savior, that’s cool, totally cool.”

    Come to think of it, this is the first ice cream I’m going to eat this summer, and it will also be the last ice cream I’m going to eat. That is if I can’t bring myself back to this world, then buying another ice cream would be impossible to do.

    *sigh*

    I should just get going, there’s no point in bringing down the mood any further, I want to eat ice cream, I really need it right now, otherwise I will die of extreme sadness.

    <p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
    The sun is so bright, I can’t look properly on the road without blinking many times, you could say my eyes are pretty sensitive on the sun’s light rays, that’s pretty normal though. I have my cap on, since I don’t want to burn my head, my brain will be fried without me knowing, that’s horrific if you think about it.

    The same road can be seen, the same houses, the same trees, and plants. Basically, the same scenery can be seen, nothing new. As I walk down the road, I looked around to everything my eyes could reached, it might be the last time I could see this place. This place, I really love it. It’s simple, and clean, that’s why I’m really attached to it.

    I continue walking through this place, while planning on buying the ice cream I wanted to eat for years.

    “Still, what’s with this blazing heat, it’s suffocating.”

    Even though this place is full of trees and plants, not any buildings can be seen, it’s still incredibly hot outside. That’s just proved how Earth is hotter than ever, effects of global warming you could say. We humans destroys Earth, and that’s the truth, which I, is also one of those. With electricity, transportation, and bad waste management are only one of the many examples that proves that I, is also one of the reasons for such phenomenon.

    “That’s depressing.”

    <p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
    Finally, I'm near the ice cream shop. It took me quite a while to arrive here, enough time for me to contemplate deeply about the Earth and humanity...

    “Finally, I’m here!”. I said as it felt like I reached the finish line.

    “…”

    “Hello, anyone here?”

    A guy from inside immediately approached me after I called out.

    “Welcome.”

    “How much is that ice cream?”

    “20 P”

    “It is sold for 20 P, Sir.”

    “?”

    What? I turned around to see who answered my question, of course it’s not the shop owner.

    “Uhhh… What is it?”. I’m confused to why did she answered instead of the seller.

    “Nothing, just telling you the price.”

    “Oh, I see. Thanks.”

    It’s a girl, and a pretty one to be exact. Well, I don’t know why she answered me though.

    “Okay, I’ll buy one.” I said to the shop owner.

    “Got it, wait a second.”

    *humming*

    “Here.”. The shop owner hand the ice cream to me.

    “Thanks.”

    “Come back again!”

    “Sure”

    Sure huh, I don’t even know if I can go back. The summer class is a one monster of a school, the probability of me surviving is low, no maybe it is 0%. It would be already lucky enough if I can pass first test, without me dying, and leaving my soulless body behind.

    “Yummy, this is pleasant to my mouth, perfect for summer.”

    I peek and glance to the girl earlier. Pretty. Looks like she is eating the same ice cream I just bought right now, I didn’t notice it earlier. Well, it’s not like I will look at her thoroughly, that would be bad, right?

    “What?”

    “Eh?”

    “I said what is it?”. She asked as I was surprised when she noticed me.

    “Nothing.”

    “Really?”

    “It’s just you look pret-“

    “?”

    “You look familiar! Yes, you look familiar, I think I’ve seen you before.”

    “I think?”, the girl asked as her face forms a frown.

    This is bad, I should escape quickly.

    “Yeah, or maybe I’m wrong, hahaha.” I laugh awkwardly.

    “…”

    “Sorry for the trouble… Hehe.”. I then quickly walk to the exit.

    “That was really awkward…”. I said to myself.

    My heart right now is beating so fast that I can’t believe it’s possible to be this fast. 

    “You’re not wrong…”. Someone said in a low voice.

    Hmmm?

    Did just someone say something to me? I didn’t hear it properly though. It was too weak to be heard properly.

    “Maybe not me.”

    *lick* *lick* * lick*

    “This is delicious.”. They are not lying when they said this is a delicious ice cream, and I am satisfied.

    I then proceed to walk towards our house, and yet again, the summer is here to toast me alive.

    <p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
    I unlock and open the door, the same inside can be seen, but the one who lives is about to go missing.

    I already finished eating the ice cream, you can’t just help but finish it quickly or else the summer will eat it.

    “Finally, I can cool down now.”

    It was too hot, walking through all that made me exhausted, and thirsty.

    I undressed my t-shirt, now my thin body can be seen, totally girls would fall in love with it. I’m so lucky if I say so myself… Really, please believe me.

    There’s one more thing I want to do before I sleep.

    “Where’s my ballpoint pen… Here… and the notebook… Hmmm… Here.”

    I then started writing in the notebook:
    <p style="font-style: italic;">- Hello! I just want to say I exist, the one who writes this exists, yes, I exist. I am Sky, mother and father, I am your son. There’s a bit of problem I encountered, so I will be gone for a year, if somehow, I didn’t come back after one year… Then, declare me as a dead person, there’s no point on trying to remember me, you will forget me, you don’t know me, by the time you read this, I don’t exist anymore. I will try my best to bring myself back here on this house, that’s what I want to do… So, yeah… Goodbye.</p>
    “That should be enough…”

    I placed the notebook on the table, they should be able to see this easily. I think writing that was pointless, since they will forget me, it’s useless… But, I want to convey my feelings, and write in a paper. I have no way of knowing if I can come back alive, it’s better to write my last message if I’m going to die anyway.

    I went to my bedroom, set the alarm clock for 23:59, and lay on my bed. It's still afternoon, but I feel like I can sleep for a long time. Feeling exhausted today, I need to prepare my mind for tomorrow.

    “My last comfortable sleep. My last comfortable sleep. My last comfortable sleep…”

    I dozed off while being half naked.

    <p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
    “Hmmm? It’s night already?”

    Night… Oh right!

    “What’s the tim-“

    *tutututu* *tutututu* *tutututu*

    “-Wa!!!”

    My phone suddenly created a soul-removing sound.

    "Phew…" I sighed while holding my chest, which was slightly hurting from the shock.

    It is already 23:59, only a minute to go, then it will be the 19th day of the summer, and it will be the time that I will be ‘forgotten’. From what I remember, Jack was teleported around 6:00 to 7:00, therefore, I still have 6 hours to until the teleportation.

    “I should go out for the last time.”

    It’s my first time going outside on the midnight. I wonder how it feels to go outside during midnight, maybe it will be scary, and cold…

    I have nothing else better to do, I will walk aimlessly tonight.
