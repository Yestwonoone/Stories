  <div id="story"><p></p>
    Day 9 of the summer vacation, the last day of Jack before he is going to be ‘forgotten’. 

    As usual I decided to look at my notes inside my smartphone, and noticed one of the notes in there has a name of “Ian is going to be forgotten”.

    “Ian?”. A name of someone I don’t know who…

    Oh, probably another ‘forgotten’?

    After reading through the notes, I understood that it was about Ian which is one of our classmates. Jack expects that something will happen to him if we are indeed right about the ‘forgotten’ people, that their names and the days are connected, and that they will be ‘forgotten’ as soon as that day comes.

    Today, Ian became ‘forgotten’, if he indeed got ‘forgotten’ then Jack’s theory will be proven right.

    As a person who’s close to the ‘forgotten’ people, we are indeed in a real dangerous situation right now. The days are approaching for us, and we still don’t know why this thing happens at the first place.

    I should try and ask him about Ian.

    *ring* *ring*

    <p style="font-style: italic;">“What’s up?”</p>
    “About-“

    <p style="font-style: italic;">“Ian right?”</p>
    “Yes, I think he is gone.”

    <p style="font-style: italic;">“You’re right, I forgot about him too. Luckily it was a good idea to leave a note before people become ‘forgotten’.”</p>
    “I guess this proves that you’re right about the initials of the names being connected to the days that they are going to be ‘forgotten’.”

    This also means I am going to forget about Jack too before I become someone who’s nonexistent at this world.

    “So, what’s the plan?”. Knowing that everything seems hopeless for us, I still decided to ask.

    <p style="font-style: italic;">“I do have something in mind...”</p>
    “Oh really? You have something in mind?”. I would have never thought that he has something in mind for this thing.

    <p style="font-style: italic;">“It’s 50/50.”</p>
    “I guess it’s better than doing nothing at all. So how do you feel right now?”

    <p style="font-style: italic;">“Not doing fine, I still don’t know what will happen to me tomorrow, maybe the Death God is going to exterminate me, haha. Still, it’s sad, knowing I only have 1 day to live. I’m just waiting for my death to come knock on our door, and I can’t do anything to prevent it.”</p>
    “I know what you feel, we’re still too young to die, really.”

    <p style="font-style: italic;">“I know.”</p>
    “I’m going to think that this is a farewell, I’m really glad you became my best friend.”

    <p style="font-style: italic;">“Me too.”</p>
    “I hope we can both be happy on the other side, as well as the other ‘forgotten’. We won’t know what their situation is right now, which is also true for both of us.”

    <p style="font-style: italic;">“That’s if we are still alive, hahaha. But if that’s the case, then I hope so.”</p>
    “You’re not going to cry?”

    <p style="font-style: italic;">“I’ll pass with that one.”</p>
    “Hahaha. You plan to do anything before the time comes?”

    <p style="font-style: italic;">“I do have a plan, but as I said earlier it’s 50/50 and I’m not sure about it.”</p>
    “Doesn’t matter. I am interested to know about this plan you’re talking about.”

    <p style="font-style: italic;">“Sure… First can you try find any smartphone in your house? Most specifically the smartphone of Dawn.”</p>
    I never actually noticed any smartphone in here other than mine… So what is he planning about this one?

    “Smartphone? What are you going to do with it?”

    <p style="font-style: italic;">“I will explain about it later.”</p>
    “Okay.”

    I tried finding Dawn’s smartphone around the house and I can’t find it in the living room. Nowhere to be found in the kitchen, as well as bathroom. The last place I’ve yet to look at would be the other bedroom, the girl’s room. I tried looking on the table, the bed and lastly the cabinet, and I can’t find any smartphone.

    Well, I couldn’t find anything.

    “Jack?”

    <p style="font-style: italic;">“Oh hey, did you find it? The smartphone?”</p>
    “No, there is no smartphone here other than mine. So, what is this about?”

    <p style="font-style: italic;">“I recently have this question in my mind, can the ‘forgotten’ people be able to bring items to the other side? Because if it is really teleportation, they might have brought some items to the other side.”</p>
    “Okay, so you want to know if somehow Dawn was able to bought her smartphone over there?”

    <p style="font-style: italic;">“Yeah, that’s it. If that’s the case, I have this plan that could be useful to you.”</p>
    “Okay so that’s what it was. I will be glad to support this plan of yours, tell me what it is.”

    <p style="font-style: italic;">“It’s pretty simple, before I get teleported, I will call your number. Not just call, but it would be along call, we are not going to end the call.”</p>
    Confused on what he is trying to say, I just listen before saying anything.

    <p style="font-style: italic;">“If the plan became successful, the smartphone of mine will be brought along with me to the other side. If the phone call didn’t stop, you might be able to hear what’s happening on the other side. You might be able to gather some information in this plan of mine.”</p>
    “Oh! That’s good. I like it, it might work, it’s worth the try if it became successful. I will support this plan of yours, so when are we going to do the long call?”

    <p style="font-style: italic;">“Thanks, I will call you 11:30 this night. Who knows I might be ‘forgotten’ in 12 o’clock exactly, it’s better to be safe. If I’m still here I will say ‘I’m still alive’ every hour, if somehow you didn’t hear anything from me at the exact hour, that’s the time.“</p>
    "Okay got it, I will wait for you.”

    <p style="font-style: italic;">"Thanks"</p>
    Call ended.

    This proves that Jack is still fighting, and here I am doing nothing for a whole day, waiting for my time to end. But I’m glad I could help him even a little about his plan, this would help me a lot before I will be ‘forgotten’, that’s if the plan became successful.

    I am hoping for the best for this one.

    <p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
    *ring* *ring* *ring*

    <p style="font-style: italic;">“Sky?” Jack answered.</p>
    “Hey, you ready?

    <p style="font-style: italic;">“Yeah.”</p>
    “You forgot anything?”

    <p style="font-style: italic;">“Nothing, the only thing left is to face the 10th day of the summer vacation.”</p>
    “I see, let’s do this!”

    <p style="font-style: italic;">“Yeah!”</p>
    I write a note in a paper beside me:

    <p style="font-style: italic;">-	No matter what happens don’t end this call, Jack the caller, is your friend. You will forget him once he disappeared or that’s what we think. If somehow Jack did teleport to the other side, you will be able to hear the other side, that’s why you shouldn’t end the call. If you forgot who Jack is, then it means he is already ‘forgotten’, he might be dead, or he might still be alive in the other side. This is the plan Jack intended to use, don’t you fail him.</p>
