    Day 9 of the summer vacation, the last day of Jack before he is going to be ‘forgotten’. I should call Jack later to see how he is, maybe it will also the last time I can talk to him. I totally have no rescue plan, I can’t save him, but at least I can talk with him for the last time, as a best friend.

    I called him.
    
    *ring* *ring* *ring*
    
    “Hello” He answered.
    
    “Yo! Jack, how are you?”
    
    “Not doing fine, I don’t know what will happen to me tomorrow, maybe the Death God is going to exterminate me, haha. Still, it’s sad, knowing I only have 1 day to live. I’m just waiting for my death to come knock on our door, and I can’t do anything to prevent it.”
    
    “I know what you feel, we’re still too young to die, really.”
    
    “I know.”
    
    “I’m going to think that this is a farewell, I’m really glad you became my best friend.”
    
    “Me too.”
    
    “I hope we can both be happy on the other side, as well as the other ‘forgotten’. We won’t know what is their situation, which is also true for both of us.”
    
    “I hope so,”
    
    “You’re not going to cry?”
    
    “I’ll pass. Besides I won’t show you my incredible face when I’m crying.”
    
    “I see. You plan to do anything before the time comes?”
    
    “I do have a plan, I don’t know if this will work.”
    
    This guy, never really fail to amaze me.
    
    “Plan you said? What are you planning to do?”
    
    “Can you try to find if you can find a smartphone in your house? The smartphone of Dawn?”
    
    “Smartphone? What are you going to do with it?”
    
    “Just find it, I will explain later.”
    
    “Okay.”
    
    I tried to find Dawn’s smartphone around the house. I can’t find it in the living room. Nowhere to be found in the kitchen, as well as bathroom. The last place to look at would be the other bedroom, the girl’s room. I tried to look on the table, the bed and lastly the cabinet, and I can’t find it. Now let’s ask Jack about this smartphone thing.
    
    “Jack?”
    
    “Oh hey, did you find it? The smartphone?”
    
    “No, there is no smartphone here other than mine. So, what is this about?”
    
    “I recently have this question in my mind, did the ‘forgotten’ can bring items to the other side? If it is really teleportation, they might have bought some items to the other side.”
    
    “Okay, so you want to know if somehow Dawn was able to bought her smartphone over there?”
    
    “Yeah, that’s it. If that’s the case I have this plan that could be useful to you.”
    
    “Okay so that’s what it is, I will be glad to support this plan of yours, tell me what it is.”
    
    “It’s pretty simple, I will call your phone, and then we will not end it. If the plan became successful, the smartphone of mine will be bought along with me to the other side, if the phone call didn’t stop, you might be able to hear what’s happening on the other side. You might be able to gather some information in this plan of mine.”
    
    “Hmmm, I like it, it might work. It’s worth the try if it became successful, I will support your plan.”
    
    “Thanks, I will call you 11:30 this night, I might be ‘forgotten’ in 12 o’clock exactly. If I’m still here I will say ‘I’m still alive’ every hour., if you didn’t call me again after an hour, it means I’m gone.”
    
    “Okay got it, I will wait for you.”
    
    “Thanks.”
    
    “Wait! Before I forgot.”
    
    “What?”
    
    “Ian, did you forget him?
    
    “Ian?”
    
    Ian… Ian.. Who is that? Another ‘forgotten’?
    “Yeah, who is that?”
    
    “Didn’t you write something on a paper about it?”
    
    “I did? Oh!”
    
    I really did forget about it. I immediately look for the notebook in the table beside my bed.
    
    “Here it is Jack! I will read it. Ian is going to be ‘forgotten’ in the 9th day of summer vacation, Ian is my classmate. If you already forgot Ian while reading this, it means Jack is also going to be ‘forgotten’ at the 10th day of summer vacation. If it’s proven, the connection between the days of summer vacation and the first letter of the person will be proven true.”
    
    “Looks, like it’s true… Anyways looking forward on working with you Sky, let’s do our best, my friend. Talk to you later.”
    
    “Okay…” I sighed.
    
    Call ended.
    
    As expected of Jack, another good idea, while I’m here just spending my time watching anime, Jack have been looking for an answer. I’m deeply ashamed, I’m glad Jack is still fighting, I will definitely support this plan of yours Jack. Thank you for helping me again even if this is your last night, I’m in your care this time again.

    *ring* *ring* *ring*
    
    “Sky?” Jack answered.
    
    “Hey, you ready?
    
    “Yeah.”
    
    “You forgot anything?”
    
    “Nothing, the only thing left is to face the 10th day of the summer vacation.”
    
    “I see, let’s do this!”
    
    “Yeah!”
    
    I write a note in a paper beside me:
    
    -	Don’t end this call, Jack the caller, is your friend, you will forget him once he disappeared or that’s what we think. If somehow Jack did teleport to the other side, you will be able to hear the other side, that’s why you shouldn’t end the call. If you forgot who is Jack, then it means he is already ‘forgotten’, he might be dead, or he might still be alive in the other side. This is the plan Jack intended to use, don’t you fail him.
