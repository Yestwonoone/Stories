    Day 10th of the summer vacation, 12 o’clock in the midnight.

    <p style="font-style: italic;">“I’m still alive.” Jack said.</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
    Day 10th of the summer vacation, 1 o’clock in the midnight.

    <p style="font-style: italic;">“I’m still alive.” Jack said.</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
    Day 10th of the summer vacation, 2 o’clock in the morning.

    <p style="font-style: italic;">“I’m still alive.” Jack said.</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
    Day 10th of the summer vacation, 3 o’clock in the morning.

    <p style="font-style: italic;">“I’m still alive.” Jack said.</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
    Day 10th of the summer vacation, 4 o’clock in the morning.

    <p style="font-style: italic;">“I’m still alive.” Jack said.</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
    Day 10th of the summer vacation, 5 o’clock in the morning.

    <p style="font-style: italic;">“I’m still alive.” Jack said.</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
    Day 10th of the summer vacation, 6 o’clock in the morning.

    <p style="font-style: italic;">“…”

    “…”

    “…”</p>
    “Jack?”

    There’s no answer. Could it be?

    “Jack? Hey Jack! Answer me!”

    Could it be he fell asleep? Or maybe he… what?

    “Jack? Who is this?”

    For some reason I currently have a call with someone that I’m not sure who is. And why is the call six hours long? What’s happening…

    I don’t have any idea who this Jack is, and why we are having 6 hours of call without me knowing why. It’s also the first time for me to have six hours long of call.

    I noticed there is a paper beside me, and I read it.

    …

    “Oh… Well, that’s something I don’t think I would even expect.”

    It’s about the plan I just forgot, but this proves that he became ‘forgotten’ that’s why I don’t remember about him and the plan. In that case I should wait for him, and if the plan is successful, then I should expect things anytime now.

    “I hope the plan succeeds.”

    <p style="text-align: center;">***</p>
    Day 10th of the summer vacation, 7 o’clock in the morning.

    <p style="font-style: italic;">“Where am I? It’s pretty noisy here.”</p>
    Is this Jack? Did the plan succeed? 

    I shouldn’t make any noise because it would be problematic if they knew there is a phone call ongoing. The question is whether Jack remembered the plan or not.

    <p style="font-style: italic;">“A classroom? Is this a classroom? Really a classroom?! What’s happening?”</p>
    He is in a classroom?

    That’s a bit surprising, knowing that everyone became ‘forgotten’ I am surprised that they are in a classroom. So he is still on Earth, that’s good. I thought it would be like another world or something.

    I am glad that he didn’t die.

    <p style="font-style: italic;">“Oh! The plan, Sky? Do you hear me? The plan succeeded, just remain silent and try to listen as careful as you can. Don’t make any sound, just listen, okay?”</p>
    “Okay” I answered in a low voice.

    <p style="font-style: italic;">“Okay, I’m glad the plan works, we should both see what is going to happen.”</p>
    And then suddenly, an unknown voice enters.

    <p style="font-style: italic;">“Welcome to the summer class students! I am Awful, Mr. Awful. Call me Mr. A, and my duty is to conduct a test on the students one by one in this classroom.”</p>
    The noise suddenly lowered down, looks like the students intends to listen to Mr. A.

    <p style="font-style: italic;">“Where is this place Mr. A? I remember sleeping on our house, why I am suddenly on this classroom?” A girl asks.

    “I can’t say where this place is, I can only say that this is a classroom where you all students are going to take summer class, and us teacher will going to test you one by one.” said by Mr. A.

    “Mr. A can I get out of here?” A guy asks.

    “Try if it’s possible or not.” Mr. A said.</p>
    …

    <p style="font-style: italic;">“What’s this?! We can’t get out of here. The door is locked and there are no windows.”</p>
    A locked classroom without windows? Okay, this is not normal at all.

    <p style="font-style: italic;">“See? You can’t get out of here unless you completed the test.”

    “Then we need to complete this test first before we can get out?”

    “Yes, that’s the basic of it.”</p>
    What a weird classroom, they are locked inside? What’s with that place?

    This doesn’t sound good at all.

    <p style="font-style: italic;">“What if we fail the test? What’s is going to happen?” Another girl asks Mr. A.

    “There’s a punishment.”

    “A punishment you said? Are you kidding me?”

    “No, I’m not.”

    “I can’t believe this, what’s with this place? You just brought us here without our permission, you are a kidnapper, I will call the police.”

    “It will not work, they will not find this place, or to be exact, they can’t find this place.”

    “What is that supposed to mean?”

    “This is another world.”</p>
    The students inside the classroom laughs, enough to burst out my ears just listening on it from the call.

    But, another world huh? I’m a bit suspicious about that place being in another world, especially knowing that the call is still ongoing without any problems. Would even out phone works in another world? That doesn’t make any sense at all.

    <p style="font-style: italic;">“Another world you said? Haha, what a joke!”

    “It’s up to you whether to believe it or not, I’m here to conduct a test, not to entertain students.”

    “Yeah, yeah, whatever. Hmmm… What… I can’t get through the police?”</p>
    They can’t call the police, but this call is still ongoing? I thought it might work especially Jack is in another world and I am still on Earth, believing what Mr. A said, then this call shouldn’t be possible at the first place.

    <p style="font-style: italic;">“I already told you, it’s impossible.”

    “For real…”

    “Mr. A I have a question.” Jack asks.</p>
    He finally asks Mr. A, I might get some information here before my time comes.

    <p style="font-style: italic;">“What is it?”

    “There are how many tests do we need to complete before we can get back to our original world?”

    “You need to complete a total of 3 tests not including this one.”</p>
    Three tests, it is lower than I have imagined. What I’m worried about it whether those test are going to be easy or hard to complete, but that should be obvious, tests are supposed to be a challenge, I’m sure it’s hard.

    <p style="font-style: italic;">“So, three tests in total, are this somehow connected to how you’ve chosen us? For 10th day of summer vacation, we students whose name starts with letter J will be teleported here, not only that we will also be ‘forgotten’ in the real world.”

    “Wow, I’m surprised someone noticed it, you’re quick. You’re the first to notice about the alphabetical teleportation, or probably not, but you are the one who talked about it.”, Mr. A then claps his hands.

    “About those three tests, think of it as prelim, midterm, and finals examination. As a teacher, I would be happy if you guys will take this summer class seriously, or else…”, Mr. A continued.

    “So that’s how it works, how about the punishment? What is the punishment?”

    “Just wait and see. Again class! Welcome to the summer class, now I am going to test you students. Please does your best to avoid failing it, no one likes punishment right? I also hate punishment too.”, Mr. A chuckled.</p>
    Listening through the phone doesn’t let me see anything about the summer class, but I am glad I was able to understand even a bit what’s about to happen if I became ‘forgotten’.

    I wonder what kind of test are this?

    <p style="font-style: italic;">“I don’t care, just start the test.” The same girl who laughed at Mr. A said.

    “We are going alphabetically! I’m starting with Jacie. Are you ready Jacie?” Mr. A asks.

    “Uhhh… I guess?” Jacie answered.

    “Then I shall start with you. I just need to put my palm over your head, and boom! It’s done!”

    “OUCH!!! OUCH!!! MY LEG!!!” Jacie screams as she cries.</p>
    W-what did just happen? For some reason Jacie suddenly screams and burst out cry.

    <p style="font-style: italic;">“Look at her go! This is the test, as you can see, she manages to pass this test. If you failed, you’re going to die. It means that your soul will leave your body, only the body will remain in this classroom.”</p>
    Huh… I don’t think I fully understand what’s happening.

    <p style="font-style: italic;">“AHHH!... MY LEG!... IT HURTS… W-what was that? My legs are o-okay?... Hah…”

    *clap* *clap* *clap*

    “Congratulations! Jacie, you passed.”

    “I passed? Hah… Am I supposed to be happy?”

    “Of course, although it doesn’t matter to me whether you passed test or not.”

    “You're playing with us, aren't you? Enough of this!”

    “I'm not toying with you, students. My intention is to help you become strong enough to conquer these tests, or it would be nice if you became a monster too.” Mr. A laughs.

    “NOOOOO! Let us out here! I don’t want to die.” Some girl suddenly run and screams.</p>
    What’s with this? I’m starting to feel unpleasant with just hearing what’s happening over there.

    What are they planning to do with the students…

    <p style="font-style: italic;">*slam* *slam* *slam*

    “I can’t still open the door!”

    “I DON’T WANT TO DIE! PLEASE!”

    “Hello? Students? Please return to your seats immediately. Anyone still standing will face consequences.”, Mr. A said.

    “Don’t joke around! We are going to get out of here!” Another student said.

    “AHHH!!!”

    “Hey… Hey Hey Hey… Whoa! Careful, why are you punching me? Easy there! You really don’t know how to behave huh?”

    “You… Shut… Up your filthy mouth!”

    “No.”

    “AHHH! WHY? IT HURTS! MY BODY HURTS!” the boy screams really hard while crying.

    “You’re weak that’s why.”, Mr. A said.

    “It seems the students are eager to take on this test. However, we won't be going alphabetically this time. I've decided to begin with our brightest student in the class..”, he added.

    “Just do it.” Jack said.</p>
    No! What am I supposed to do? Stand here and listen to Jack suffer?

    <p style="font-style: italic;">“Don’t worry about me, I’m strong.” Jack said as it feels like he read my mind.</p>
    I guess… I got worried for nothing.

    <p style="font-style: italic;">“Okay.” Mr. A then said.

    “AHHHHH!, W-what was that? That hurts… Ugh… Was it a car accident?” Jack said.</p>
    A car accident? What is that supposed to mean? This test is about a car accident?

    <p style="font-style: italic;">“You’re really strong, I’m impressed. You’re right, you experienced a car accident, awesome right?” Mr. A said.

    “Awesome my ass, that hurts a lot… How did that happen? Did you teleport me?”

    “No that was only on your mind, as you can see from others earlier, they didn’t get teleported.”</p>
    Only in the mind? Maybe it’s like inserting fake memories? And after that you will experience pain but your real body is not affected, because that’s how I understand it knowing everyone started screaming and crying.

    <p style="font-style: italic;">“Only on my mind? I experienced 3 minutes situation in the test right? And it only happened instantly in this world?”

    “Yes, it felt long to you, but for us in the classroom it was only for an instant.”</p>
    That’s… Somehow really unbelievable. If they are able to change the torture at will, making it as awful as possible, can we the students even complete this test? 

    <p style="font-style: italic;">“What a convenient torturing ability.”</p>
    Indeed, what a convenient torturing ability. No wonder they suddenly screamed out of nowhere, this mind torture was the reason, this is scary.

    <p style="font-style: italic;">“Convenient you say? Maybe you’re right."

    “Did I pass the test?”

    “You did, as long you are able to go back in this classroom.”

    “So how one can go back in the classroom?”

    “The will to live is needed.”</p>
    Will to live… That sounds cool.. But doesn’t change the fact that everyone screams and got hurt mentally.

    <p style="font-style: italic;">“I see, like you said earlier, if one is not able to go back in the classroom, your soul will leave your body, is that right?”

    “Yes, only your body will be left in the classroom, but what’s the point? There’s no way a soulless body could be useful, simply because it’s lifeless.”

    “Can you send back the soul into the body again?”

    “No, it’s not possible. Once you are soulless, I can’t bring someone’s soul back. You’re already broken at that point.”</p>
    They will die?

    …

    If that is true, then… This is more dangerous than I thought.

    <p style="font-style: italic;">“I see, thanks for the explanation, I pretty much understand how the summer class works.”

    “No problem… Let’s proceed to the next person, Sky you’re next.”</p>
    I felt a sudden pain in my chest.

    Huh? What did he just say? Did he just called my name and said I’m going to be the next one?

    Nah, that’s a-

    <p style="font-style: italic;">“What do you mean? Sky? Who’s that?” Jack asks.

    “Don’t play dumb with me, I know you know Sky, aren’t you having a nice phone call with him? Ahhh, friendship, what a wonderful thing.”</p>
    -lie… Hehe… Heh… He knew about our phone call? *gulp* 

    What a scary teacher… This smells like trouble…

    <p style="font-style: italic;">“How did you know? When did you learn about it?”

    “When did you think I learn about it?”</p>
    The only time where Jack didn’t respond to me in the call is between 6 o’clock in the morning and 7 o’clock in the morning, I guess he learned about it that time, probably when he was sleeping?

    <p style="font-style: italic;">“When I was sleeping? You checked our bodies, and found out that I was having a phone call with Sky. You thought it was interesting to see how will things turned out and just let it be. Right?” Jack said.

    “CORRECT! You earned a hundred points, congratulations! That’s right! It will be interesting to see how will the phone call will turn out so I decided to not do anything. Hey Sky! Did you learn something? There are still 9 days before your turn, I’m expecting good things from you, I already found Jack as an interesting student. To think both of you already knew how the selection works, and even planned this phone call, really interesting, SUPER INTERESTING! I’m waiting for you Sky, you might as well say goodbye to your friend, after 9 days who knows what will happen to him, he might become a monster, or he might get killed, you know what I’m saying?  Are you ready to challenge this summer class? Don’t even think about of escaping, because you can’t escape us. You have no other choice but to challenge the tests here, that’s the rule.” Mr. A happily announced this through the classroom.</p>
    “Shut up! I’m surprised that you act like a teacher, when you’re not even a teacher, you’re a kidnapper.” I angrily replied in the phone call.

    <p style="font-style: italic;">“Thank you very much for those compliments, I’m really grateful to have you as a student, I’m waiting for you in the 19th day, don’t you run away.”</p>
    “You don’t need to tell me what to do, I’m not going to run away, you’re the one who’s going to run away.”

    <p style="font-style: italic;">“Big words, I like It, tell me about it after you get in here.”</p>
    “You wish.”

    <p style="font-style: italic;">"In the 19th day I will welcome you.”</p>
    "Thank you for being a considerate.”

    <p style="font-style: italic;">“Then, I will welcome you Sky on the summer class! Expect great things in this class, it will surely change your life for WORSE. Are you ready to challenge this class?”</p>
    “I don’t care about your class at all, I’ll have you wait for me.”

    <p style="font-style: italic;">“Thank you very much for that wonderful answer. I promise that I will not run from you.”</p>
    “As I wanted.”

    Call ended.
