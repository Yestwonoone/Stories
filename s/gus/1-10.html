    Day 10th of the summer vacation, 12 o’clock in the midnight.

    Day 10th of the summer vacation, 6 o’clock in the morning.
    
    “…”
    
    “Jack?”
    
    There’s no answer. Could it be?
    
    “Jack? Hey Jack! Answer me!”
    
    Could it be he fell asleep? Or maybe he… what?
    
    “Jack? Who is this? And why he is calling me? WHAT? 6 hours of call? This is unbelievable, and I don’t even have any idea who this caller is.”
    
    Don’t have any idea who this Jack is, and why we had a 6 hours of call without me knowing why.
    
    I noticed there is a paper beside me, and I read it.
    
    “Oh… Well, that’s something I don’t think I would even expect.”
    
    I see that’s the plan, and I forgot about it. 
    
    I should wait for him, and if the plan is successful, then I should expect things anytime now.
    
    “I hope the plan succeeds.”
    
    ***
    
    Day 10th of the summer vacation, 7 o’clock in the morning.
    
    “Where am I? It’s pretty noisy here.”
    
    Jack? Is this Jack? Did the plan succeed? I shouldn’t make any noise because it would be problematic if they knew there is a phone call. The question is whether Jack remembered the plan or not.
    
    “A classroom? Is this classroom? Really a Classroom?! What’s happening?”
    
    He is in a classroom? That’s a bit surprising, so he is still on Earth, that’s good. I thought it would be like other world or something.
    
    “Oh! The plan, Sky? Do you hear me? The plan succeeded, just remain silent and try to listen as careful as you can. Don’t make any sound, just listen, okay?”
    
    “Okay” I answered in a low voice.
    
    “Okay, I’m glad the plan works, we should both see what is going to happen.”
    
    And then suddenly, an unknown voice comes.
    
    “Welcome to the summer class students! I am Awful, Mr. Awful. Call me Mr. A, and my duty is to conduct a test on the students one by one in this classroom?”
    
    The noise suddenly lowered down, looks like the students intends to listen to Mr. A.
    
    “Where is this place Mr. A? I remember sleeping on our house, why I am suddenly on this classroom.?” A girl asks.
    
    “I can’t say where is this place, I can only say that this is a classroom where you all students are going to take summer class, and us teacher will going to test you one by one.” said by Mr. A.
    
    “Mr. A can I get out of here?” A guy asks.
    
    “Try if you can.” Mr. A said.
    
    …
    
    “What’s this?! We can’t get out of here. The door is locked and there are no windows.”
    
    “See? You can’t get out of here unless you completed the test.”
    
    “Then we need to complete this test first before we can get out?”
    
    “Yes, that’s the basic of it.”
    
    What a weird classroom, they are locked inside? What’s with that place?
    
    This doesn’t sounds good at all.
    
    “What if we fail the test? What’s is going to happen.” Another girl asks Mr. A.
    
    “There’s a punishment.”
    
    “A punishment you said? Are you kidding me?”
    
    “No, I’m not.”
    
    “I can’t believe this, what’s with this place? You just bought us here without our permission, you are a kidnapper, I will call the police.”
    
    “It will not work, they will not find this place, or to be exact, they can’t find this place.”
    
    “What is that supposed to mean?”
    
    “This is another world.”
    
    The students inside the classroom laughs, enough to burst out my ears just listening on it from the call.
    
    But, another world huh? Then how is it possible that this call works? I don’t know, can’t think of any idea.
    
    “Another world you said? Haha, what a joke!”
    
    “It’s up to you whether to believe it or not, I’m here to conduct a test, not to entertain students.”
    
    “Yeah, yeah, whatever. Hmmm… What… I can’t get through the police?”
    
    “I already told you, it’s impossible.”
    
    “For real…”
    
    “Mr. A I have a question.” Jack asks.
    
    Jack finally asks Mr. A, I might get some information here before my time comes.
    
    “What is it?”
    
    “There are how many tests do we need to complete before we can get back to our original world?”
    
    “You need to complete a total of 26 tests including mine.”
    
    26… 26… That’s a lot. What I’m worried about it whether this test is easy or hard to complete, but that should be obvious, tests are supposed to be a challenge, I’m sure it’s hard.
    
    “So, it will be alphabetical? Like how you chosen us? For 10th day of summer vacation, we students whose name starts with letter J will be teleported here, not only that we will also be ‘forgotten’ in the real world.”
    
    “Wow, I’m surprised someone noticed it, you’re pretty smart and quick. Yes, me Mr. A will be the first one, and Mr. Z will be the last one. If you students manage to complete all 26 tests you will be able to get out of here.”
    
    “So that’s how it works, how about the punishment? What is the punishment?”
    
    “Just wait and see. Again class! Welcome to the summer class, now I am going to test you students, do your best and avoid failing it, if you don’t want to get punishment by failing.”
    
    “I don’t care, just start the test.” The same girl who laughed at Mr. A said.
    
    “We are going alphabetically! I’m starting with Jacie. Are you ready Jacie?” Mr. A asks.
    
    “Uhhh… I guess?” Jacie answered.
    
    “Then I shall start with you. I just need to put my palm over your head, and boom! It’s done!”
    
    “OUCH!!! OUCH!!! MY LEG!!!.” Jacie screams as she cried.
    
    I was shocked. What did just happen?
    
    For some reason Jacie suddenly screams and burst out cry.
    
    “Look at her go! This is the test, as you can see she passed. If you failed you’re going to die, it means that your soul will leave your body, only the body will remain in this classroom.”
    
    Huh… I don’t think I fully understand what’s happening.
    
    “AHHH!... MY LEG!... IT HURTS… W-what was that? My legs are o-okay?”
    
    *clap* *clap* *clap*
    
    “Congratulations! Jacie, you passed.”
    
    “I passed? Heh… Heh… Am I supposed to be happy?”
    
    “Of course, although it doesn’t matter to me whether you passed test or not.”
    
    “You devil... Stop toying us!”
    
    “I’m not toying with you students, I just want you to be strong enough to complete the tests, or it would be nice if you became a monster too.” Mr. A laughs.
    
    “NOOOOO! Let us out here! I don’t want to die.” Some girl suddenly run and screams.
    
    What’s with this? It’s really unpleasant. What are they planning to do with the students there…
    
    *slam* *slam* *slam*
    
    “I can’t still open the door!”
    
    “I DON’T WANT TO DIE! PLEASE!”
    
    “Hello? Students? Please remain on your seats. All of you who are standing there, do you want to get punished?”, Mr. A said.
    
    “Don’t joke around! We are going to get out of here!” Another student said.
    
    “Hey… Hey Hey Hey… Woops! Careful, why are you punching me, Oops! You really don’t know how to behave huh?”
    
    “You… Shut… Up your filthy mouth!”
    
    “No, you shut up your mouth.”
    
    “AHHH! WHY? IT HURTS! MY BODY HURTS!” the boy screams really hard, while crying and falling into his knees.
    
    “You’re weak that’s why”, Mr. A said.
    
    “Well, it looks like the students here are excited to have a taste of the Test A. But instead of going alphabetically, I want to start with our smartest student in this class.”, he added.
    
    “Just do it.” Jack said.
    
    NO! Jack, What I’m going to do? Will I just stand here and listen while Jack is going to suffer?
    
    “Don’t worry about me, I’m strong.” Jack said as it feels like he read my mind.
    
    I guess I got worried for nothing.
    
    “Okay, let’s do this, and… Boom! Done!” Mr. A then said.
    
    “AHHHHH ugh, what was that? That hurts… ugh… A car accident huh?” Jack said.
    
    Car accident? What is that supposed to mean? Did he experience a car accident in Test A? Is that how the test works? Huh?
    
    “You’re really strong, I’m impressed. Yes, you experienced a car accident, awesome right?” Mr. A said.
    
    “Awesome my ass, that hurts a lot. Did you just teleport my body?”
    
    “No that was only on your mind.”
    
    Only in the mind? Maybe it’s like inserting fake memories? And after that you will experience pain but your real body is not affected…
    
    “Only on my mind? I experienced 3 minutes situation in the test right? And it only happened instantly in this world?”
    
    “Yes, it felt long to you, but for us in the classroom it was only for an instant.”
    
    That’s… Really unbelievable, if they are able to change the torture at will, making it as awful as possible, can we the students complete this test? This seems impossible to complete, and I will experience the torture too in the Day 19th.
    
    “What a convenient torturing ability.”
    
    Indeed, what a convenient torturing ability. No wonder they suddenly screamed out of nowhere, this mind torture was the reason, scary.
    
    “Convenient you say? Maybe you’re right.”
    
    “Did I pass the test?”
    
    “You did, as long you are able to go back in this classroom.”
    
    “So how one can go back in the classroom?”
    
    “The will to live is needed.”
    
    Will to live… That sounds cool.. For real…
    
    “I see, like you said earlier, if one is not able to go back in the classroom, your soul will leave your body, is that right?”
    
    “Yes, only your body will be left in the classroom, but what’s the point? There’s no way a soulless body could be useful, simply because it’s lifeless.”
    
    “Can you send back the soul into the body again?”
    
    “No, it’s not possible. Once you are soulless, you’re dead, you can’t go back anymore. You’re already broken at that point.”
    
    Whaaat?! Die? They will die for real?
    
    “I see, thanks for the explanation, I pretty much understand how the summer class works. Is there other way to go back without going through Test A to Z?”
    
    “Yes, there is.”
    
    “What is it?”
    
    “Not today Jack, you might learn it in the other class, but not here, it’s too early.”
    
    “Okay, I understand.”
    
    “Okay! Let’s proceed to the next person, Sky you’re next.”
    
    Huh? What did he just say? Did he just called my name and said I’m going to be the next one? Nah, that’s a-
    
    “What do you mean? Sky? Who’s that?” Jack asks.
    
    “Don’t play dumb with me, I know you know Sky, aren’t you having a nice phone call with him? Ahhh, friendship, what a wonderful thing.”
    
    -lie… Hehe… Heh… He knew about our phone call? *gulp* What a scary guy. I’m in danger. Really.
    
    “How did you know? When did you learn about it?”
    
    “When did you think I learn about it?”
    
    The only time where Jack didn’t respond to me in the call is between 6 o’clock in the morning and 7 o’clock in the morning, I guess he learned about it that time, when he was sleeping?
    
    “When I was sleeping? You checked our bodies, and found out that I was having a phone call with Sky. You thought it was interesting to see how will things turned out and just let it be. Right?” Jack said.
    
    “CORRECT! You earned a hundred points, congratulations! That’s right! It will be interesting to see how will the phone call will turned out. Hey Sky! Did you learn something? There are still 9 days before your turn, I’m expecting good things from you, I already found Jack as an interesting student. To think both of you already knew how the selection works, and even planned this phone call, really interesting, SUPER INTERESTING! I’m waiting for you Sky, you might as well say goodbye to your friend, after 9 days who knows what will happen to him, he might become a monster. Are you ready to challenge this summer class? Don’t even think about of escaping, you can’t escape us. You have no other choice but to challenge the tests here, that’s the rule.” Mr. A happily announced this through the classroom.
    
    “Shut up! I’m surprised that you act like a teacher, when you’re not even a teacher, you’re a killer.” I angrily replied in the phone call.
    
    “Thank you very much for those compliments, I’m really grateful to have you as a student, I’m waiting for you in the 19th day, don’t you run away.”
    
    “You don’t need to tell me what to do, I’m not going to run away, you’re the one who’s going to run away.”
    
    “Big words, I like It, defeat me then.”
    
    “You wish.”
    
    "In the 19th day I will welcome you.”
    
    "Thank you for being a considerate.”
    
    “Then, I will welcome you Sky on the summer class! Expect great things in this class, it will surely change your life for WORSE. Are you ready to challenge this class?”
    
    “Don’t even think of running.”
    
    “Thank you very much for that wonderful answer. I promise that I will not run from you.”
    
    “As I wanted.”
    
    Call ended.
