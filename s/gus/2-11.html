    I haven’t had a sleep yet since that call.

    Thinking about why I just said that yesterday, I’m so dumb. Talking and acting big like I have a chance to defeat such a monster of a teacher. When in reality I don’t even have any plans in mind on how I can counter that teacher. 

    But being awake gave me time to think about my plans for the other side, and if possible, I want to be able to do all of them properly. I could die at any moment once I show any weakness, that’s how I find the teacher over there a real monster.

    Let’s list the things I wanted to do:
    -	To find my ‘friends’, and to reunite with them.
    -	To complete the four tests. Mr. Awful test, and the three other tests.
    -	To be able to meet the mastermind. I would like to name this person as Summer.

    Now that's some high hurdle, let's review it once again.

    First, I want to find my 'friends' and to reunite with them.

    Thinking about this, I’m not sure if this is possible, for the reason that I don’t know anything about the white classroom. Mr. Awful said you can’t get out unless you completed the test, but it’s not clear if after the test we will be able to see everyone else, and I’m talking about the students with other initials. Because if It’s possible, I would want to meet with Jack first, and ask him about what’s the situation.

    If this other world is like any other school, it means we can get out and meet someone once the class is over. If we are lucky enough, we can meet our 'friends' That's great and all, but I'm sure it wouldn't be a happy reunion.

    At yesterday's call, students are faced with this so called 'Summer Class Test' where they are supposed to complete this test to protect their lives. The first test that Mr. Awful conducted was to let students to experience a car accident in their mind, they are able to feel the pain but only mentally, and so their real body which is located on the classroom is totally unharmed. There is one thing exception, if these students don’t have the will to live, or the will to go back to the real world, they will die. They will become soulless, only their body will be left alone in the classroom, it won't move anymore, and will have no life anymore. It's impossible to bring back the soul, but who knows, I think there might be some way to bring back someone’s soul.

    Normally, a person after experiencing such a test will lose their will to live. However, I’m not too sure about everyone else, since the test is supposed to ‘shock’ students, I guess they wouldn’t be able to know everything about the test? And from the call itself, it looks like no one has lost their soul yet, but I haven’t heard anyone else other than the first three including Jack… If we are lucky, there is a 100% chance that the students will be able to clear this test.

    Thinking positively, I want to know if such thing is possible. No one actually wanted to die right? *sigh*

    I knew in tests, you are supposed to use your mind to the greatest extent. Some tests proved themselves to be tricky at some point, even if you are a genius, if you can't expose the trick, you will lose greatly.

    I’m not nowhere being smart. All I can think of now is about the test Mr. A is conducting, that's the only thing I could think now.

    But reunion huh… As I said, me meeting with my 'friends' wouldn't be a happy reunion. I can think of two reasons why that’s the case, but I would still be glad to meet even one of them.

    -	First, I don't have any memories with them anymore, it was removed, most likely by the mastermind, Summer. 
    -	Second, they are currently troubled of the tests. They could already be broken at the point when we have reunion, negatively speaking.

    Let's confirm it one by one.

    First, most likely our memories were removed by the mastermind, Summer.

    I don’t remember anything about them other than them being my ‘friend’, which is everyone. 

    Most of these things are unbelievable, but all I can do now is to believe that it is indeed possible since I experienced it firsthand.

    Going back to the problem, if our memories are removed, then most likely our reunion would be awkward. Being friends again sounds nice but as I said at the second problem, it is unlikely to be easy to do. They are not the same as in the past, they are different now. I forgot who they are, but I’m not sure if it’s the same case for everyone else.

    Second, the worst problem out of the two, us students would be troubled by the test.

    Troubled means, we are distracted by the terror of the test, it could mean the time where we will be broken, and unable to go back at our real selves. Being broken and scared is the worst thing that could happen to us, fear is a powerful emotion, and I'm weak against it.

    There’s a tiny ray of hope, or there is probably none. A weak person like me, would surely have a hard time during the tests. The best thing I could do is to survive, and to surpass my limits. In short, I need to change myself, and to be a stronger person. Which I don’t know is possible at all, I don’t think humans would be able to change that fast, that includes me…

    The second thing I plan to do in the other world, is to complete the four tests provided by the teachers. I think, this is the hardest out of all three plans I plan to complete.

    Basically, I want to conquer the tests, to be able to complete it. I'm sure it would cost a lot, and the scary thing, is to lose my sanity. Just from hearing what’s happening inside the white classroom, I already knew it’s not a place for weak minded people.

    To become a monster, that’s what needed.

    Mr. Awful already know what will happen, you will not be able to conquer this monstrous test unless you became a monster yourself.

    When I heard about it, I’m quite not too sure what he meant by that. But my thought about it is that a person must throw away everything to be able to complete such tests. That doesn’t sound good at all, but I guess that’s what being a monster is all about.

    Everything is mysterious, without information it will be harder to win, and that's one really scary thing. Think about it, the tests, the teachers, the mastermind, everything, it's all mysterious. I suspected the test to be from easy to hard, it means Mr. Awful's test would be the easiest one. Then, the final’s test would be the hardest one, something that could broke me beyond I can imagine.

    Lastly, my third and final plan, is to defeat Summer, which honestly I have no idea how to.

    Summer, the mastermind, who removed our memories, and the reason for the teleportation of the students.

    To be honest I'm not sure if Summer exists, I just assumed Summer exists because it works better for me. If Summer exists, then I could hate him, without Summer, then I don't know where I will direct my anger. 

    A being like Summer would satisfy my anger. I would be glad if Summer really exists, and not just some imaginary being of mine.

    I guess that's all my main plan for the summer class. For the remaining eight days, I need to strengthen my mind. The question is: how can I do it in such a short period of time?

    Yeah, how do I do that? I can't spend my time just watching anime for the rest of the time, although I prefer that, since I don't know if I will be able to come back here. But what I want to do now is to plan my way through the summer class, and if I'm lucky enough I will be able to come back here.

    Think... Think... What should I do to strengthen my mind, to be able to defeat Summer? 

    Think... Think... Think... Think... There should be a way, a way to be a monster... A monster? That's not my plan, my plan is to be a strong person... 

    But, isn't that the same? No, my plan avoids throwing away myself, I want to be able to come back without being broken. Yes, that's what I wish to do. Think... Think... Think... Think... Think... Think...

    "Hmmm?"

    Solution, other solution, said by Mr. Awful. He said there is another way to complete the test without undergoing through such tests, but he didn't reveal it, as he said it's still too early. Then, we can expect to hear the other way of completing the tests during the later tests.

    I wonder what could he mean by that?
