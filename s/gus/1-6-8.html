  <h1>Day 6-8</h1>

  <div id="story"><p></p>
    I woke up. It is the sixth day of the summer vacation, nothing different from yesterday, I’m still alone on this house. I reached out my hands to my phone, it’s 9:30 in the morning, and it’s hot inside here in the bedroom. You’re really doing your job summer.

    “I should grab some drinks and biscuits, I’m getting hungry” I grabbed some milk in the refrigerator and poured it in a glass, I also grabbed some biscuits, it would be bad if I became a milkman. Same routine like always, I’ve eaten and drank what I have prepared in the room, I’m comfortable eating in my room, although it’s hot in the morning.
    
    *ring* *ring* *ring*
    
    The phone rang, I reached out to it and saw Jack’s name written on it. “Jack? Maybe he needed something.” then I answered it.
    
    “Sky? There’s another one.” He said.
    
    “Another one? Of what?”
    
    “Another unfamiliar name, while looking through my contacts right now, I noticed there is another unfamiliar name.”
    
    “Who is it? Do you think it is one of our ’friends’, one of your family, or one of our classmates?”
    
    “The name is Farria, I don’t know if Farria is one of our ‘friends’, classmates, or one of my family. Looks like the name is from a girl, if that’s the case maybe she is not one of our ‘friends’. Since the ‘friends’ that comes here in our house are all boys, not even one girl, it means she is not our ‘friends’. Maybe a classmate or a family of mine.”
    
    “I see that’s what happened, do you have any idea why you forgot her?”
    
    “No idea, like yesterday, I just forgot her. I’m clueless to why those people were forgotten by us.”
    
    “No luck huh.” So, there’s another victim of the ‘forgotten’, we two still have no idea how it picks people. “Do you think these ‘forgotten’ people were picked randomly?” I asked.
    
    “That could be the case, but if it’s not, maybe there are some clues, clues that could help us understand this problem.”
    
    “You’re right, there should be some, otherwise this problem would be unbeatable."
    
    “I almost forgot to say, I noticed something strange yesterday night about the names of the ‘forgotten’”
    
    “Strange? I didn’t notice anything.” I didn’t really pay any attention to it. Hence, I didn’t find any odd about it. And Jack said he found something strange about it?
    
    “Yeah, recall the names."
    
    “Ace, Caddie, Cadmus, Caleb, Callan and Dawn. What about it?”
    
    “Include Farria on the list, and we have names that starts with letter A, C, D and F. Only letter B and E is missing. Farria didn’t got forgotten until today, and Dawn as you said you only forgot he/her on Thursday.”
    
    “Okay, I don’t get what’s weird with that?”
    
    “Today is the sixth day, which is Saturday, and Dawn was forgotten on the fourth day which is Thursday.”
    
    “I still don’t get what you are pointing out.”
    
    “Name each letter with corresponding number, make it in alphabetical order, if letter A is one then what about letter B?"
    
    “Letter B is two, letter C is three, letter D is four, letter E is five and letter F is six. Okay, then?”
    
    “Then think of those numbers as a day, since the summer vacation started.”
    
    “First day is letter A, second day is letter B, third day is letter C” and then I stopped.
    
    Is he saying that the day in the summer vacation and the ‘forgotten’ people’s name are connected? Then since it is the sixth day and corresponding letter is F, people with names that starts with letter F will be forgotten? Then Ace was forgotten on the first day, Caddie, Cadmus, Caleb, and Callan was forgotten on the third day, and Dawn was forgotten in the fourth day.
    
    “Now I get it, the names and the day are connected, and you will be forgotten according to the first letter of your name. Then in the 19th day, I will be forgotten since my name starts with letter S. And you whose name starts with letter J will be forgotten in the 10th day.”
    
    “That’s right, I think that’s how the ‘forgotten’ works. Then I only have 4 more days to live.”
    
    “Don’t say that! We don’t even know if you are going to die”
    
    “Being forgotten is the same as being dead.”
    
    So that’s what he meant by that. Even if I say I’m not going to forget him, I’m pretty sure I will still forget him. The good thing is, the name in paper and the smartphone still exist, if that’s the case I could write something that says Jack is my friend, and write all the information we gathered together.
    
    “I could write something in the paper or in the memo on my phone about you. There’s still no guarantee I will not forget you, but at least I can remember you as a friend, and about the thing that we discussed. So, it’s not that you are really forgotten, you still exist.”
    
    “Thanks, that would be nice. Speaking of writing, I should write Ian’s name in the paper, since after 3 days it would letter I’s turn. That way we can confirm that there is really connection on the name and the day of the summer vacation.”
    
    “Ian huh? I should try that too. Thanks for the news, this really helped me a lot. Bye”
    
    “Bye, don’t you forget me.”
    
    “Yeah, I will not.”
    
    Call ended.
    
    What a call. I’m surprised how Jack solved the mystery, he really did pay attention on my story. This is scary, it’s like waiting for your death. We did solve the mystery, but we don’t know how we can prevent it.
    
    “I should spend my remaining time to watch many anime as I can, I don’t know where the ‘forgotten’ people go, and even if I know I can’t do something about it.”
    
    I then proceed to watch anime on my smartphone. My goal right now is to watch as many anime as I can, I don’t have anything to do other than that. Foods are not a problem, it should still keep me alive for 18 days, oh I forgot, I only have 13 days left to live.
    
    There are still 13 days left before people forgot me.
    
    I’m going to die, maybe.
    
    Summer, I hate you.

    <h1>Day 7</h1>
    
    Day 7 of the summer vacation, I watched anime for a whole day.
    
    <hr>
    <h1>Day 8</h1>
      
    Day 8 of the summer vacation.
    
    Today, is the last day of Ian, if he indeed got ‘forgotten’ then Jack’s theory will be proven right. That would be a real disaster to us.
    
    Also, today, I watched anime for a whole day.
