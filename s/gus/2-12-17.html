    I can’t take this…

    Seeing a sight of these things is such a horrible sight for everyone, and I’m supposed to get used to this? In a way, this is like torturing myself to watch something I don’t even to watch.

    The sight of these horrific, gruesome deaths appears before my eyes—bodies scattering around, and blood gushing out. People screaming, shouting, and crying are visible. My heart aches as I watch this.

    Accidents on the road involving cars, trucks, and motorcycles result in broken hands, broken bodies, broken faces, dislocated arms, and dislocated legs. People are pierced with the remains of the vehicles...

    It’s scary enough to see something like this.

    I should continue this tomorrow.

    <h1>Day 13</h1>
    Once again, the sight of frightening accidents appeared before my eyes.

    I want to get used at this scene, to strengthen my mind, and to prepare myself for first test. There is actually a huge difference, in here, I’m just a spectator not the victim. However, in the first test I’m the victim. 

    This is the only thing I could think of right now, and now I will proceed to watch the same thing all over again.

    *crash* *crash* *crash*

    Lots of screaming and crying, body smashed and blood everywhere, totally gruesome. There are accidents where trucks hit cars, wrecking them, and smashing the passengers. Some drivers lose control, some are drunk, and some drive too fast, this all of which lead to horrific accidents, taking lives and shattering families.

    A video where a guy got pierced with the front glass of the car can be seen.

    “Ouch!” I shout, as if I was the one who got pierced.

    I immediately pause the video. I paused myself for 30 seconds, and then continue to watch it.

    “Wooo… That was brutal.”. As the person got killed straight from the dash cam of the car.

    I then continue and continue to watch some more.

    "Such incredibly unfortunate events.”

    I can't help but wonder if this is their destiny?

    <h1>Day 16</h1>
    “Bloods… Bloods… Again, with bloods.”

    These accidents seem never-ending, the pain and gruesome sights are like poison to me.

    <h1>Day 17</h1>
    “A meat, no that’s-“

    It looks like a meat… But it is a brain… A brain… Is scattered alongside the truck’s wheels.

    “-a brain, haha, oh please…”. These videos just made me face horrible gruesome deaths and I don’t feel so good.

    The plan is to make myself unaffected to such accidents, although it did work mentally, as I don’t feel shocked anymore but that’s it. The pain inflicted is not included, the test is about experiencing a car accident, in a sense what I’ve been doing is useless.

    Emptiness, is what I felt after watching these videos. I’m indeed used to it now, the repeating sight from the past five days, is brainwashing my mind. I’ve watch accidents countless times now, there’s no point on continuing now.

    “I’m not scared anymore at these accidents videos.”. After watching it for a long period of time, it became a normal sight to me, that it’s scary to think that you are able to feel nothing from seeing videos about someone’s death.

    To think that watching these accidents videos repeatedly could remove my fear in it, it’s scary that it’s possible to be immune at someone’s death after watching the same kind of video that many times. But who knows, I haven’t seen one in real life, I don’t know how much it could affect me.

    A part of me thinks that I should be happy, I mean removing one of my fears? Isn’t that a wonderful thing? To be able to do that, I might be a magician myself, haha. Unbelievable, as days passed, I’m slowly getting to the dark side, the side I shouldn’t touch, let alone accept.

    I knew things about myself, I knew it. I knew I wouldn’t go to the dark side, I knew I would be able to be a decent person, I knew I don’t get angry easily, I knew I wouldn’t end another person’s life, I knew I would also cry at other people sufferings, I knew I wouldn’t inflict damage to others, and I knew who is Sky. That’s me, I knew myself, I’m Sky, I’m me, I’m still me.

    One thing I’m glad is that I still feel sadness, the sadness and guilt from watching these videos. It’s still here in my heart, these feelings. They are not removed, these feelings that made up me, that keeps me as a human being.

    “I’m sorry…”

    I respect dead people, so, the sight of me watching their accidents countless of times just to break myself is just plainly disrespect to the victims. This is not the result that I wanted to create, this is a mistake, a big mistake.

    I will avoid myself from self-inflicting pain slowly, this is a suicide. I’m ashamed of myself, to waste the life given to me, is the dumbest thing I did in my entire life.

    To defeat Summer in my very best decent condition would be the greatest achievement ever.

    I should take a rest.
