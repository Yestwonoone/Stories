    The first class just ended, and there’s still no sight of Leo in here. This must be mean something happened to him after the message.

    Everyone is still wondering what happened to him, since he ran away from the class last week, and I know that I am the reason for that.

    Although I’m not sure what exactly happened to him. I did notice him being different after I started doing it, he is looking restless, and I caught him glancing at random places.

    As the teacher gets out after the first class, everyone gossips about what happened to Leo.

    Right, I know that no one knew about his past, no one at all.

    About his brother and father, they know nothing about it.

    Even the fact that he is a bully.

    Everyone is clueless, and I doubt they will be able to learn what happened to him. They would probably create fake gossip around Leo even knowing nothing about the situation.

    *door opens*

    "Leo and Zee, help me bring these books to the next room," our first class teacher said.

    I grab one of the stacks of the books on the table, and proceed to the exit.

    “You’re amazing.”

    I glance at my left shoulder, and I saw Zee walking beside me.

    Why is he talking to me right now?

    I ignored him, there’s no point in talking with him.

    “It’s no coincidence, right? That Leo suddenly acts differently last week?”, he added.

    Well, he’s right.

    We place the book on the table in the next classroom, and we both exit the room at the same time.

    “You know, I surrender.”

    I look at him as he said that.

    “You heard it right, I surrender.”

    How did he get suspicious of me? I’m sure I managed to do it without any problems.

    “If you’re wondering how, it’s no brainer. Who would do it other than you?”, he said as if he was able to read my mind.

    “What are you planning?”, I asked.

    “Woah? I never thought that you would reply.”, looking surprised to the fact that I just talked. “As I said, I surrender. I know that you’re the reason why Leo acted like that, or you’re saying that I’m somewhat wrong?”, he added.

    “You are wrong.”, I said as we arrived at the room.

    Without saying other than that I return back to my seat.

    Thinking about Zee earlier, I wonder how he got suspicious of me.

    Did I do something wrong? How did he find out about it?

    The only explanation I can come up with is that I am the victim of their bullying, which must be the reason for his suspicion of me. Must be thinking that I’m getting revenge, and if that’s the reason, then he is right about it.

    I did expect them to suspect me, but I never thought Zee would catch on so quickly.

    I felt a light tap on my shoulder, and I glanced over my shoulder.

    "Let's talk about it," Zee said enthusiastically.

    It’s not going to hurt if I listen to what he is going to say.

    We walked together with his arm over my shoulder.

    > > >

    We are sitting in front of each other at a single table.

    “I’ll tell you something first. . . Let’s work together.”, Zee said while looking serious.

    Collaborate, huh...

    "You seem intrigued", he added.

    I don’t dislike the idea, but this doesn’t sound favorable at all.

    “Did you think this is a good idea?”

    “Why else would I suggest it? I'm aware that you're also planning to come after me."

    As I thought.

    “And you want to work with me despite the situation?”

    “Think about it, why would I let you go after me? It doesn’t make any sense for me to just let you do that.”

    He’s right about that.

    “Besides it’s not my fault that both Robert and Leo bully you, It’s entirely Robert’s fault.”

    “I know.”

    “But if you ask me, I don’t have any idea why Robert would do that to you, or maybe I do have an idea but I’m not too sure about it. I heard that Robert punched you out of nowhere in the past, that’s also the time when I found out that both Robert and Leo are bullying you behind the building.”

    I can’t do anything against them.

    “You know I didn’t participate in the bully, right?”, he added.

    That’s right, he only watches me getting punched and kicked by both Robert and Leo.

    “So, I was hoping you spare me, and instead I will help you.”, he suggested.

    In a sense, he is like Luna, where they only watch me, and never actually do anything.

    But the idea of working together with someone doesn’t sound bad, it’s just I’m a bit suspicious of his sudden behavior.

    “Do you want to kill him?”, he asks while looking straight at my eye.

    Surprised by the question I looked at him confused.

    It never crossed my mind to kill someone, nor did I feel the need to kill someone.

    “Oh, you must be not thinking about it. Well, that works fine as well.”, he added as he goes back to his normal face.

    “If you are going to work with me, what are you planning to do?”

    “Think about it something like making my high school life interesting.”

    Huh?

    “What’s that supposed to mean?”

    “Let’s not talk about me anymore. Let’s talk about whether you’ll agree to team up with me or not.”, he said, brushing off my question.

    “I don’t believe this is going to be beneficial for me.”

    “I know you’re going to say that, that’s why I will tell you something that you probably didn’t notice.”

    Something I probably didn’t notice?

    “It’s about Maia.”, he added.

    “Let’s hear about it.”

    “I think everyone knew that you like Maia.”

    Oh right, that one.

    “What about it?”

    “You remember that she cried right?”

    I know, it’s something I can’t forget.

    “What about it?”

    “I was wondering if you did something to her.”

    “Nothing.”, I replied immediately.

    “I have no idea too.”, he said.

    . . .

    “Don’t look at me like that. As I said earlier there is a thing you probably missed, it’s about Robert.”

    It’s true, it’s not that I am knowledgeable when it comes to people.

    “I know that most of the guys like Maia, she is beautiful and is friendly to everyone.”

    “What are you trying to say?”

    “Robert likes Maia, simple as that.”

    Oh. . .

    “I didn’t know about that.”

    I honestly never paid any attention to anyone, other than Maia.

    “I bet, that’s what I’m saying.”

    “And, what about it?”

    Zee scratches his head as I asked that.

    “Do I need to explain everything to you?”

    I never really thought about their reason for bullying me.

    But learning that Robert likes Maia, must be the reason why he is angry at me, since most people thought that I’m the reason to why Maia is crying.

    Up until now, I can’t seem to understand why Maia cried.

    “I generally have the idea that Maia is the reason.”

    That’s why I’m planning on attacking her, not now, but later.

    “Oh?”, he laughs. “I see, I see. Then I’m expecting some things to happen sooner.”, he added.

    This guy. . .

    “I’m telling you, I’m not going-“

    “Shhh Shhh, don’t think about it that much.”, he said stopping me from saying anything.

    "I might know something that you're not aware of," he said while having a serious look on his face.

    “Is that supposed to scare me?”

    “Maybe?”, he chuckles. “Before I leave, I’m asking you to spare me from your attack.”, he bows his head.

    I don’t know about that.

    “Oh right Septo. . .”, he looks back at me. “As proof of teaming up with you, I’ll do something different in the class.”, he then walks away out of the canteen.

    . . .

    This was unexpected. I didn’t think that he would propose that we should team up against Robert, it didn’t occur to me that Zee would suggest such a thing.

    What could he be planning. . .

    But in any case, I’m not planning on teaming up with him at the moment.

    Our teacher is currently handing out our quiz papers. I scored slightly higher than half of the total possible points.

    “And lastly. . . Zee.”, the teacher calls out Zee.

    How did that happen? Zee having the lowest score in the quiz?

    Is this what he meant by doing something different?

    “What happened?”, concerned, the teacher asks Zee.

    “Just a bit of a personal problem sir.”, he replied.

    “Oh is that so? 	Be sure to take care of yourself.”, tapping Zee’s shoulder.

    “Yes sir.”, he then goes back to his seat.

    Everyone looks at Zee, a few of his seatmates reach out to him to ask about what happened, but he just said that it’s nothing.

    He really did something unexpected.

    “Quiet class!”, with a loud voice from the teacher, everyone closes their mouth.

    If the student who’s always at the top scores suddenly became in the last place, everyone would be shocked. . . Everyone would find it odd that he suddenly has the lowest score.

    In that case, I should consider his proposal and abandon the attack I'm planning.

    > > >

    What a week.

    A lot of things happened so fast that things are sailing smoothly for some reason.

    Especially knowing that Zee made a move before I can even do something. This made things a bit faster than I initially thought, that I believe something is wrong, or something bad is about to happen.

    As I walked out of the room, people start grouping around Zee, hoping to get answers out of him. But he didn’t say anything, other than him saying that it’s nothing.

    Knowing that I can’t understand Zee’s plan, I need to be careful around him.

    *buzz*

    My phone vibrates.

    It’s probably from her.

    <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">
    - Maia -</p><p style="font-style: italic">
    [ I just got home. Something crazy 
    happened. ]</p>
    <p style="text-align: right">
    [ I just got home too just a moment 
    ago. What is it? ]</p>
    <p style="font-style: italic">
    [ Do you remember the classmate I 
    told you last week? ]</p>

    Of course, there’s no way I would forget that.

    <p style="text-align: right">
    [ Yeah, the one who suddenly ran away
    to the outside all of a sudden? ]</p>
    <p style="font-style: italic">
    [ Yes that one. It turns out he
    plans on dropping out this year. ]</p>

    What. . .

    <p style="text-align: right">
    [ Is that true? Is there any reason
    for that? ]</p>

    I didn’t think it was enough for him to drop out a year because of that.

    <p style="font-style: italic">
    [ Yeah, some of his friends tried
    visiting him, but the mom said that
    he plans on dropping out. ]</p>
    <p style="text-align: right">
    [ That’s quite unfortunate. ]</p>
    <p style="font-style: italic">
    [ Yeah, it’s unexpected really.
    But that’s not all actually. ]</p>
    <p style="text-align: right">
    [ There’s more? ]</p>
    <p style="font-style: italic">
    [ There’s this one smart student in
    our classroom who’s always at the top
    spot, guess what? On the recent
    quiz, he got the lowest score. ]</p>
    <p style="text-align: right">
    [ Woa, is that true? How did that
    happen? ]</p>
    <p style="font-style: italic">
    [ No one knew, all we know that
    he said that it’s a personal
    problem. ]</p>
    <p style="text-align: right">
    [ He probably had a bad day that
    time, but it’s still shocking that
    he is in the last place. ]</p>

    Everyone was surprised, including me. The thought of the smartest person in the room getting the lowest score in a quiz is shocking and definitely sounds impossible, but it happened.
    
    <p style="font-style: italic">
    [ You’re right, everyone is shocked. ]

    [ So how was your day? ]</p>
    <p style="text-align: right">
    [ Very simple and the same as other
    day, learning lectures and stuff. ]

    [ Nothing new, but it was a good day. ]</p>
    <p style="font-style: italic">
    [ Picture ]</p>

    She sends a picture of her drinking an orange drink that is in a bottle.

    Looking at it, it reminds me of my past self, who likes this person.

    I still find this girl as beautiful as in the past.

    But. . .

    I don’t like what she did.

    The rejection, the way she cried, those things that don’t make any sense tells me about how I don’t like what she did in the past.
    
    <p style="text-align: right">
    [ That looks good, how’s the taste? ]</p>
    <p style="font-style: italic">
    [ It’s good and refreshing.
    This is one of my favorite
    drinks. ]</p>
    <p style="text-align: right">
    [ Oh right, I’m going to do something.
    Let’s talk about things tomorrow. ]</p>
    <p style="font-style: italic">
    [ Oh sure, bye Shan. ]</p>
    <p style="text-align: right">
