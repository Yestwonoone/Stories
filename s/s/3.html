    While I was walking under the sun, I noticed a familiar figure of a person whose one of my friends in the past. I haven’t seen her in a while, the biggest shock is that I never thought I would see her today.

    I called out to her.
    
    “Is that you Maia?”
    
    She immediately turns around and looks at me.
    
    “I haven’t seen you for a year.”
    
    Biggest surprise for the summer break, the face I haven’t seen, and it still looks the same.
    
    “Luna?”, She then hugged me. “How are you? What a coincidence, how did you find me?”, She asked.
    
    “Knowing you for years I wouldn’t mistake your figure, it’s simple as looking for a tree.”
    
    “Well, we haven’t seen each other for a while let’s grab something to eat.”
    
    “Sure.”, I happily responded.
    
    It’s been a while and it reminds me of our friendship, I’m happy to meet her again.
    
    We didn’t talk while walking, and then we reached the shop who sells burgers and drinks. Since I’m not a fan of burgers, I’ll just look for a cola to drink.
    
    “What do you want to eat? It’s my treat.”, She said.
    
    “Well, it would be waste to say no, I’ll just take some cola.”
    
    “No burgers?”
    
    “No burgers.”
    
    “Oh right, you’re not a fan of burgers.”
    
    “Good to know you still remember it.”
    
    “Of course, it’s my way of messing with you.”
    
    I guess she is still the same for that one.
    
    “Right right, then as a pay buy me the largest cola drink here.”
    
    “That’s unhealthy you know?”
    
    “It’s fine trust me, or else I’m going to pass out anytime soon.”
    
    “What are you talking about.”, She chuckled.
    
    She bought one medium burger and one small cola drink for herself, and I got myself a large cola drink.
    
    I slowly took a sip, and it was heavenly. Under the scorching sun, a sip of large cola drink is refreshing enough for everyone.
    
    “Good?”, She asked me.
    
    I nodded in response. “Feels great, thanks for the treat.”
    
    . . .
    
    After finishing her burger, she drank the whole cola in a few seconds like some monster.
    
    “Wow”
    
    “What?”
    
    “I guess you’re too thirsty huh.”
    
    “Who wouldn’t be thirsty at this time?”
    
    “Me probably?”, I jokingly asked.
    
    “Oh right, you probably passed out any time now if I didn’t buy a large cola drink for you.”
    
    “I thank you for that, you’re the only one who bought free foods for me.”
    
    “Really?”
    
    “Yeah, does that sounds weird? I asked.
    
    “Kind of.”
    
    In what way though?
    
    . . .
    
    We found a wooden chair in the park and took a sit. Thanks to the large body of trees in here, it’s very refreshing even if it is in the middle of the afternoon.
    
    She threw her junks away, but I still have my large cola drink.
    
    “Maia.”, I called out to her.
    
    “Hmmm?”
    
    “How’s school there?”
    
    She and I didn’t communicate for over a year now, and even though we are close friends it didn’t happen. Her contact information is no longer available, she probably thinks that it’s better to cut off everyone from the school before transferring, and this includes me.
    
    “It’s very normal.”, She answered. “Nothing amazing, but it’s been a normal every day for me.”
    
    That’s good to hear.
    
    “I’m happy to hear that. I haven’t heard anything from you, and you also changed your contact information, I have no way of contacting you.”
    
    She scratched her head. “Oh right, I guess you will understand why I did that.”
    
    Of course, but I’m worried.
    
    “Still, it would be nice if I was able to contact you, I was worried.”
    
    I don’t know what Septo did, but I knew that Septo is the reason for this.
    
    She laughs awkwardly… “Hahaha… Can you forgive me?”
    
    “No worries. I’m just glad I was able to meet you her coincidentally, I am happy to see you looking well. I never though I would see you here, I thought you move house?”
    
    “We did.”
    
    “Oh really? Because I was wondering why I found you here.”
    
    “It’s simple, we are in the largest and the only park in the town.”
    
    “Oh…” 
    
    “And you didn’t even know where I live.”
    
    “I guess, I never had a chance to know where it is.”
    
    The topic about houses never occurred when we are still friends together. The only way I know to contact her is her phone number, which doesn’t work anymore, or she probably don’t want to reply to me, or just simply blocked me.
    
    “We both don’t know where each other houses are.”
    
    “All we talk about is nonsense.”
    
    “And food!”, she said.
    
    We both laugh together.
    
    “But don’t worry.”
    
    “What do you mean?”
    
    “I’ll give you my contact number, so you won’t be sad.”
    
    “You finally did something good today.”
    
    “The large cola drink?”
    
    “Ah right, I forgot. Thank you once again.”
    
    After she finishes putting her contact information, she asked me.
    
    “What happened to everyone?”
    
    The question made me confused.
    
    “What?”
    
    “I said what happened to everyone?”
    
    Everyone?
    
    “Our classmates?”
    
    “Yes.”
    
    “I guess they are fine?”
    
    “Why you’re not sure?”
    
    “Did you even think I have as many friends as you do?”
    
    She laughed.
    
    “Who knows right? I just thought you might have some friends other than me.”
    
    “I did have, one other friend other than you.”
    
    “Oh really?”, she responds happily.
    
    “Yes, it’s a new friendship, just a month ago.”
    
    “A month ago? That’s like the last week of the school year.”
    
    “Yeah.”
    
    “And you get friends at that time? That’s the worst possible time to create friendships.”
    
    “As long as we became friends, I think it’s all fine.”
    
    “Right, I should be happy for you for having a new friend. Care to tell me who it is?”
    
    “It might be shocking.”
    
    “Shocking in what way?”, Confused on what I just said, she asked.
    
    “It’s Septo.”
    
    “Septo!?”
    
    The way she suddenly raised her voice of because of what I just said, definitely sounds like it is too unexpected for her.
    
    “Yes, shocking right?”
    
    “Give me a few minutes to calm myself.”
    
    It’s a new sight to see, seeing how shocked she is, it’s my first time seeing her like this.
    
    Thinking about it…
    
    Before getting suspicious of Septo, I wonder and wonder what kind of thing he did to Maia, that’s enough for her to transfer schools. Right, no one would transfer schools like that suddenly, unless he did something unbelievable to her.
    
    The problem is I don’t know any details, I don’t know what Septo did so I can’t just carelessly talk about Septo here.
    
    Because even I, don’t know if Septo confronts Maia directly, or he did something without revealing himself to her. Because if he did it without confronting directly, it explains how no one get suspicious of him the whole school year other than me.
    
    But right, it’s possible that some of us became suspicious of what’s happening inside the school. Especially before Maia transferred, one of our classmates, Leo, suddenly stopped going to school. It’s been a news to school, and rumors arose, no one knew what happened.
    
    When a classmate suddenly stops going to school, it does feel odd, since no one knew what happened. An active student like Leo, suddenly stopped going to school, would make everyone wonder why it happened at the first place.
    
    I looked at Maia, she is still resting her head at the chair and doesn’t look like she wants to talk any time soon.
    
    In my eyes that time, nothing seemed unnatural, but everyone would think twice especially someone absence for a long period of time is not natural.
    
    I remember the whole class talking about him after being absent for a whole week, even I and Maia talked about it. It was a whole topic for a month, and no one knew why he suddenly stopped. Even asking his close friends wouldn’t have any idea.
    
    That time, I didn’t know that Septo was the reason for it.
    
    Simply because he doesn’t show any signs of being part of it.
    
    Thinking how he got bullied by those three, one could only think he is doing this to get revenge.
    
    I can’t believe he is doing this, I am sad seeing him like this.
    
    “You look like you’re about to cry.”
    
    “What?”, I was shocked to suddenly hear her talking.
    
    “What are you thinking?”, She asked me.
    
    “Oh, it’s nothing.”
    
    “If it’s nothing and it makes you sad, it’s probably a movie.”
    
    “Right, it’s a movie.”
    
    Of course, it’s a lie, but I didn’t notice I was looking like I was about to cry.
    
    “I was thinking for a while…”, She said. “I guess you really do like Septo?”, She asked.
    
    “Like? I guess I like him as a friend.”
    
    “No, I mean you like her as a man.”
    
    “Definitely not.”, I respond immediately.
    
    “Really? I really thought in the 6th grade you are interested in him.”
    
    “Why would you think that that’s the case?”
    
    “I just kind of feel, or maybe you felt sorry or something… Because I always see you looking at him at the room.”
    
    Oh, that one.
    
    “I talked with him one time in the past, I think he is a good guy. I found nothing wrong when I was talking with him, but rather I feel he is safe to talk to.”
    
    “I didn’t know you had that kind of history with him, is this in the 6th grade?”
    
    “Yes, it’s when he got punched by Robert. I met him somewhere in the weekend, a day after that I guess?”
    
    And a thing that bothers me the most, is that I still don’t know why at that day, the day when Septo confessed to Maia…
    
    Maia was crying when she entered the room, and everyone didn’t know why.
    
    “Oh that time.”, She said.
    
    …
    
    “I thought you didn’t know about it? You’re crying at that time, right?”
    
    It’s true, there’s no way she could’ve know about it when her head is down in the table. All I know that she was crying the whole time, everyone is at her table, she couldn’t possibly know what happened to Septo.
    
    “I’m crying did that happen?”
    
    “Remember when Septo confessed to you?”
    
    “Oh!... That time?”
    
    “I couldn’t believe you forgot about it.”
    
    I let out a sigh.
    
    “Well, if you ask me about it, I remember Septo confessing to me, but I couldn’t remember it that well.”
    
    Considering she cried that time, I can only think she wants to forget that day.
    
    “I guess it’s understandable because it’s been years. But I’m wondering, where did you learn that Septo got punched?”
    
    “Everyone was talking about it, you certainly underestimate my friendship network throughout the class. Having many friends does gives you advantage, like knowing latest happenings, and knowing many dangerous things.
    
    “Wow… That sounds bad, feels like you know everything.”
    
    “I know some, but definitely not everything.”
    
    I nodded.
    
    “You know…”, Maia suddenly talks.
    
    “Ever since Septo transferred in the school, I feel something changed. In a way I couldn’t understand, but I just feel everything became unpleasant for the classroom.”
    
    “I feel you, but do you think Septo is the reason for that?”
    
    Which is true. Septo said it himself, he wants revenge.
    
    “I don’t know, but I don’t see him doing any of that.”, She responded.
    
    “It definitely doesn’t look like he would do it, I also think he seems like a good person when we first talk.”
    
    “But… Did everyone know Septo is getting bullied?”
    
    What?
    
    I looked at her…
    
    I didn’t know she knew about that.
    
    “What? Why do you look like that?”
    
    “No sorry, I’m just shocked. I didn’t know you knew that Septo is getting bullied.”
    
    “When? When did you learn about it?”, I continued.
    
    “Robert told me himself.”
    
    Robert? He told Maia about it? For what reason?
    
    Then, she knew all along that it was Robert who is the bully.
    
    “So, you knew that Robert is the reason for that?”
    
    “Yes, but I’m surprised you knew about it.”
    
    “I saw Robert when he punched Septo in the classroom, but I once saw them again, where Robert punched and kicked him behind the school building.”
    
    That’s a lie, I’ve been looking at Septo getting hurt multiple times, but…
    
    I didn’t do anything to help him.
    
    I am scared, Robert also saw me.
    
    I can’t tell the teachers about it, because Robert might target me as well. 
    
    “I guess we both knew about it.”, She laugh awkwardly.
    
    This makes me think, why Maia didn’t help Septo despite knowing about it…
    
    I see… I guess I understand a little why Septo decided to get revenge at her.
    
    We both didn’t help Septo when he was getting bullied, I guess we are indeed friends for being the same.
    
    “Right, that’s why I want to become friends with him. I didn’t have the courage, but I finally managed to talk to him after 4 years.”
    
    “I’m kind of half happy for you.”
    
    “You must’ve dislike Septo that much.”
    
    “Not that much.”, She responded. “But rather I am confused why you decided to befriend him.”
    
    “Coming from a person who is befriend the whole classroom?”
    
    “Hahahahaha”, She laughed. “You’re right, there’s nothing wrong with him. He is quiet, but I also think he is a good person.”.
    
    But in the end, he got bullied, and ended up being like that.
    
    “So how is it, being friends with him?”, She added.
    
    “You said why it’s been only a month ago before we become friends right? It’s because for a few months he didn’t talk to me, he was being silent the whole time… Can you imagine that?”
    
    “I know he is a quiet person, but there was never a time he is silent with me… Maybe at first, but after a while I think he responds all the time.”
    
    Of course she likes you.
    
    “Good for you, I feel like I was talking to a statue, he is there but he is not talking and responding.”
    
    “I’m surprised you managed to keep at it for that long.”
    
    It’s my guilt that pushes me to keep doing it.
    
    “I don’t know, maybe because I just lost my friend suddenly without any notice and that’s the reason for it.”
    
    “I know I know, I’m sorry about it.”
    
    I laugh.
    
    “It’s fine, I’m just happy to meet you again.”
    
    She bowed to me. “Thank you miss.”
    
    “Oh right. I still need to do something, I’m going first.”, She said.
    
    “Okay sure.”, I waved goodbye to her.
    
    “We can talk again in the next time.”
    
    She walked away, looked, and waved back to me.
    
    I responded with another wave.
    
    And she’s gone…
    
    I am surprised, I didn’t know that she knew about Septo getting bullied. Is that the reason why Septo decided to get revenge at her?
    
    If that’s the case, wouldn’t Septo get angry at me too?
    
    That’s…
    
    I didn’t think of it that much, but I might be the next target, right?
