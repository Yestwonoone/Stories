    <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 35px; margin-bottom: -70px;"> < Monday Morning > </p>
    
    It’s the start of the 11th grade, and there are some few changes I can see right now. But I would say, there is one important change that I’ve noticed right now.
    
    Robert is not our classmate anymore.
    
    Earlier when I’ve look through the list of classes in the 11th grade, I first look for my name, after knowing that I am in this class, it’s time to look for my classmates.
    
    As I was reading through the names, I noticed that Robert is not in the same class. So, I decided to look for his name, and learned that he is from the class next door. Which is surprising considering that we are always classmates, excluding the first two years of high school.
    
    I guess this works good for me, now that I won’t see that face of him anymore. 
    
    “Yo!”
    
    Luna tapped my shoulder without me noticing her, and with that I looked at her.
    
    She smiled at me, but didn’t say anything.
    
    Right, we are friends now. That explains why she is like that, I guess that counts as a morning greeting?
    
    I don’t know.

    <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: -35px;"> < Monday Afternoon > </p>
    
    “Septo, let’s eat together.”
    
    Immediately after the introduction of the new grade, she suddenly appeared.
    
    “Why?”, I asked her.
    
    “You know that we are both hungry right?”
    
    “I know, but why should we eat together?”
    
    “Because I want to do it, think of it as a celebration for being a 11th grade student, and a celebration of our friendship.”
    
    I can’t say I like that.
    
    “What do you think?”, She asks while smiling.
    
    Well, it would be best to just accept this and go through it.
    
    I nodded as response.
    
    I grab my whole bag and walk together with her.
    
    “What did you notice?”, She asked.
    
    “What exactly you are talking about?”
    
    “Anything about today.”
    
    “Robert.”, I answered.
    
    “I guess you wouldn’t see his face anymore.”, She chuckled.
    
    “In the class yes, but it’s still possible outside the room.”
    
    “I just want peace you know.”, She said while looking straight.
    
    “I am with you.”
    
    “Right.”, She smiled at me.
    
    “I will tell you some things later, let’s eat first.”, She continued.
    
    > > >
    
    “You noticed the commotion?”, She asked me after we finished eating.
    
    I did notice it.
    
    “I think there was, but I’m not sure.”
    
    “It’s from the 9th grade.”
    
    “A 9th grader?”
    
    Why would be there commotion on the first day of the classes because of a 9th grader?
    
    “Yes, someone just came back.”
    
    “And it caused the commotion throughout the school?”
    
    Then, it must be some popular person.
    
    “It’s Leo.”
    
    Oh…
    
    “Is that true?”, I asked.
    
    “Yes, you should be able to see him anytime soon. That should also explain why there is a commotion. I mean Leo is one of the students where everyone at school started thinking of what happened to him, making countless of rumors circulated through the school 2 years ago.”
    
    It took him 2 years to go back, does that mean I successfully did something?
    
    “What are you thinking?”, Seeing I didn’t respond to her she asked me.
    
    “Just thinking. Leo spends a year without doing anything, that sounds bad.”
    
    “You know you are the reason for that.”
    
    “I know. But to tell you honestly, I am not aware of my consequences.”
    
    It’s true, and all I want is to get revenge, to do something as to reflect some damage. To know how it feels, how it feels to inflict damage.
    
    But, I didn’t think much of the consequences.
    
    “Do you think I should?”, I continued.
    
    “I know, you are saying that they don’t deserve pity, because that’s how everything looks like to me. I think that’s what you’re trying to say.”
    
    I think that’s right. I nodded.
    
    “But you know, I’m thinking that there must be some reason for everything.”
    
    “What do you mean?”, I asked.
    
    “Ahhh, I don’t know how to explain it. I am saying that I’m confused with all these happenings because of you and everyone.”
    
    She must be complaining.
    
    “Oh right. I met Maia.”, She added.
    
    I guess she is still somewhere near here.
    
    I believe everyone at the room don’t have any contact information with Maia, because that’s what I’ve been hearing from them in the past year. I guess that includes Luna, or maybe not because they I knew that they are close friends.
    
    It must been some great luck for Luna to be able to meet Maia, good for her.
    
    . . .
    
    Without responding, she broke the silence.
    
    “What did you do to her?”
    
    Now we are asking this kind of question?
    
    “Why do you want to know?”
    
    “I want to know, because I am in the front of the culprit, but I can’t do anything. You know I am hopeless, but I am worried as her friend.”
    
    As her friend huh…
    
    “I remember that, the two of you being close friends.”, I responded.
    
    It was in the past, but Maia thinks of Luna as her close friend. Now, Luna became my friend, I think it was quite unexpected turn at least, considering I consider Maia as my enemy.
    
    “I would rather not tell you about it. I know it’s not something I could share.”, I continued.
    
    I don’t trust you.
    
    “I know, you don’t trust me.”
    
    That’s true.
    
    “Do you plan on getting rid of me too, Septo?”
    
    That’s what she has been thinking the whole time?
    
    “I didn’t expect you would say that.”
    
    “Right… I’ve been thinking about it these days.”
    
    The encounter with Maia is probably the reason for this.
    
    She started leaning her head on the wooden chair.
    
    “I’m scared.”, She continued.
    
    After she said that she remained silent the whole time.
    
    . . .
    
    I think I should do something about this.
    
    “It’s a celebration, right?”, I asked.
    
    “I know.”
    
    “Then act like it.”
    
    “Sorry.”, She then wipes her eyes with her arm.
    
    “Red eyes.”
    
    “Hahaha.”, She laugh awkwardly. “I know, let’s grab something earlier after class.”
    
    “Your treat?”
    
    “Sure, just make sure you are going to accompany me.”
    
    I nodded as response.
    
    “You like burgers?”, She asked.
    
    “It’s fine.”
    
    “Okay”, She then gave me a thumbs up. “Let’s go, class is about to start.”
    
    . . .
    
    While we are walking Luna suggested something. 
    
    “What do you think of visiting the 9th grade?”
    
    I’m a bit curious of what’s happening in there, so I think it would be fine.
    
    I nodded as response.
    
    As we reached the rooms of the 9th grade, to avoid any unnecessary problems, what we did is to just peek instead of standing through the door.
    
    . . .
    
    We managed to peek inside the class, and we both saw Leo talking with his classmates.
    
    “What do you think? He looks fine and looks like he already has friends inside the classroom.”
    
    Considering how active Leo in the class is, he is overall someone you can easily talk to. It’s understandable that most of his new classmates would take interest to him, and because he is friendly it would be easy for them to talk with him.
    
    “It’s expected.”, I responded.
    
    “You plan on doing something again?”
    
    “Once is enough.”
    
    She looked at me, looking amazed.
    
    “Oh, I think I must lower my evil meter of you.”
    
    What the hell is an evil meter? I don’t even want to ask her what kind of meter is that.
    
    “Don’t worry I’ll explain it to you in the near future.”, She continued.
    
    With that we proceed to our classroom for the afternoon class.
    
    > > >
    
    Afternoon class just ended.
    
    “Wait for me at the gate, Septo. I need to do something first.”, She said then suddenly dash outside the room.
    
    Hopefully it doesn’t take too long, I don’t want to stand doing nothing.
    
    But the thing I’ve seen earlier outside the room does raise some concerns. He must be trying to reach out someone in the class.
    
    In any case, I should be careful, things might get messy.
    
    > > >
    
    As I was waiting for Luna for about 5 minutes, I can finally see her running towards me.
    
    “Sorry… Hah… Hah… Shall we go?”, She said while looking like she was about to pass out.
    
    “Learn how to breathe first.”
    
    She then took a deep breath for a few seconds, and when she was satisfied, we started walking.
    
    “You know earlier I found something interesting.”
    
    “Leo and Zee right?”
    
    “What!?”, She lets out a very loud voice.
    
    “Can you please not shout?”, I said to her.
    
    “My bad…”, She laughed. “But how did you know?”
    
    “Just a hunch, I saw Leo walking around outside the classroom earlier. So, I thought he was looking for Zee, and they probably decided to talk after class. Isn’t that the reason why you said you’re doing something first?”
    
    She let out a sigh, a sigh that says she is disappointed.
    
    “You didn’t even let me talk about it.”
    
    I didn’t respond.
    
    “Agrhhh!”
    
    That definitely sounds like defeat.
    
    . . .
    
    “Well, that’s my defeat, let’s go grab something.”, She said as she completely recovered from earlier.
    
    “You’re okay with a burger, right?”, She continued.
    
    I nodded as response.
    
    “As a punishment we’re going to eat some burgers.”
    
    A punishment? How is eating burgers a punishment? Or is there something wrong with burgers? I don’t know.
    
    After she ordered we decided to take a sit.
    
    “You like burgers?”, She asked.
    
    Well, if I had to choose between like and dislike, then I like it.
    
    “It’s fine.”
    
    “How about me? I don’t know, let’s find out.”
    
    What… I didn’t even ask you.
    
    . . .
    
    After few minutes, the burger is finally ready. Both are medium sized burgers, one medium sized cola and one large sized cola.
    
    I guess she likes cola that much, and here I thought medium sized cola is already too much for me. I wouldn’t want to imagine the large sized cola, it’s too much for me.
    
    As I was biting the burger, I can see Luna looking at me.
    
    
    “You looked happy eating the burger.”, She said.
    
    “I don’t remember being happy while eating a burger.”
    
    “It’s now, better remember it.”
    
    I looked at her burger, but it is still unwrapped.
    
    “Eat.”, I said.
    
    “Don’t worry about me, keep eating, it’s my treat.”, She said while smiling.
    
    After biting multiple times, I managed to finish my medium sized burger. I also took a sip of the cola, and it was satisfying.
    
    I want to lay down…
    
    “Here.”, She said while handing the burger that is still unwrapped for some reason.
    
    “What?”
    
    “I’m not a fan of burgers.”, She laugh awkwardly.
    
    I guess that’s the reason why this is a punishment, even though the burger tastes good.
    
    “Just try taking a bite.”
    
    She waved her hand indicating she doesn’t want to do it.
    
    Okay, if that’s what you wanted.
    
    As I open the wrapper, I noticed something.
    
    I looked at her. “What’s this?”
    
    “I mean, it would be a waste to not eat it.”
    
    There’s a bite in the burger, and it’s rather small, or more like a pinch.
    
    “Then you should eat it at the first place.”
    
    “I tried, but I don’t really like it. I’m hoping you could eat my share so it wouldn’t go to waste.”
    
    Instead of saying anything, I decided to eat it. After eating, I drank all the cola, and threw it at the trash can.
    
    “Thanks for the treat”, As I said that, I noticed that she is still drinking the cola.
    
    She then gave me a thumbs up. “We should go home now, it’s getting dark.”
    
    I nodded, and then we started walking.
    
    “Septo,” *sip* “remember be careful,” *sip* “those two might plan something against you.” *sip* “Well, you kind of deserve it.” *sip*
    
    “Can you at least pick one between talking and sipping the drink.”
    
    She laughs, knowing she managed to annoy me.
    
    That’s right, I didn’t expect that Leo and Zee will talk again, if they are indeed on planning something against me, I think it’s best to be careful. It might do me more harm if I just let them go unnoticed.
    
    “I might need your help again.”
    
    She nodded. “I’ll try, but don’t expect anything.”
