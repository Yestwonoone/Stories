    "Is Leo here?"

    ". . ."

    Everyone looked at the door wondering who that was.

    "Leo! Someone is looking for you."

    What's this about?

    . . .

    "I saw this mail on the road earlier."

    "Oh. . . Who is this for?"

    This guy looks like someone from the lower grade. . . I wonder what's this about.

    "It is written for you as it shows here. . .". He then handed me the plain white envelope.

    Looking at it, I don't find anything suspicious as it looks normal, and it does say that it is for me. . . But there's nothing written about who is the sender.

    "Do you have any idea who is the sender?"

    "No idea, I just saw it on the road earlier before the morning class starts."

    "I found it odd for a mail to be in a road."

    "I wish I was lying about this, but I indeed found it lying in the road. It probably fell off the sender's hand while she is walking earlier. I found it near the school gate, I'm surprised no one decided to touch it."

    I look at it again and slightly laugh about the situation.

    "Hahaha... I don't know how to feel about this, but thanks for delivering this one, I appreciate it."

    "No problem. . . Hoping you find success on that envelope.". He smiled and walked away.

    "An envelope huh. . ."

    I guess this is the one Shru's was talking about. . .

    . . .

    After sitting I started looking at everyone in the class. . .

    "What was that about Leo?"

    It felt like everyone wanted to ask what was that about.

    "Wrong person, he was looking for another Leo.", I answered.

    "Oh. . ."

    They definitely didn't expect that.

    Looking disappointed they started doing their own business.

    . . .

    Looking at everyone one more time again, I wonder if one of them is Shru. . . 

    Or at least that's something that I believe would be the case, because it doesn't make sense that someone in another grade is messing with me.

    If there is probably someone. . .

    It would be Septo.

    Knowing Septo, he doesn't actually do anything. . . I haven't seen him doing any actions, but he would be the most suspicious person, and probably he is Shru.

    As someone who I bullied, he is the person who has a grudge against me.

    As I was the shitty person to Leo, I was a friendly person to almost everyone. 

    If there is someone who would probably mess with me, then it's definitely someone who has a grudge against me. . .

    Right, Septo?

    As if he heard that one.

    I looked at him. But as always, he is looking far away outside the window.

    Even though he transferred back in here after two years, I don't see any difference between his 6th grade and now his 9th grade situation.

    Still, the same quiet and dull person, looking bored, and does not interact with anyone.

    . . .

    With the envelope in my right hand, I am holding it below the table.

    I wonder if this is about Shru or it's another thing. . . But I should lean more to the worst side. . .

    Most likely this is Shru's work.

    I remember him saying that there is a random student who is going to hand this, and most probably this is the one.

    I slightly shake the envelope, and there's something inside. . . I tried touching it. . .

    This is definitely a picture.

    I'm a bit curious as to what kind of picture is this, knowing that Shru said he is going to give me a reason to be interested in his pranks.

    . . .

    It might be the best idea to wait until the evening before I open this thing up.

    <hr>
    <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: -35px;"> < Wednesday Evening > </p>

    I just got home, and I am looking at the envelope in my right hand.

    Opening it, I was welcomed yet by another piece of picture, but the difference is it's a lot bigger than the 1x1.

    *gasps*

    . . .

    A picture of our family.

    I see. . . I slightly laugh in disbelief at what I just saw.

    “What an effort.”

    Seeing how some members have their faces cut off, which are my brother and my father, Shru really knows something about us.

    Is he saying that he knew what happened to my family?

    In the family picture, there are four people, but only two faces are visible, my face and my mother's face. The rest have been cut off, probably with scissors. Both my brother's face and my father's face have been cut off.

    I don’t think I told anyone about my situation, how did he manage to find anything about this?

    Yes, no one knew. That’s what it’s supposed to be.

    . . .

    Could he be one of my old classmates? Is Shru someone I knew from my past school? If he is indeed from my old school, then what could he be planning by sending me this picture and messing with me?

    I was a fairly good student in the past before I met everyone else here, it doesn’t make any sense for an old classmate of mine to harbor any ill intention to me.

    Right. . . Then I don’t have any idea.

    If he is not from my old school. . . How could he possibly know anything about what happened to me before I transfer schools?

    As I didn't share anything about my family situation with my friends here when starting a new life, I believe someone is trying to disturb me by bringing my past back to the surface.

    I feel like my life is in danger.

    . . .

    I tried messaging the same contact of Shru, but it failed. . .

    My feelings are in mixed right now. I wonder if I should get angry or get scared knowing that someone knew about my past.

    My very past, and my punishment is within the sight now. . .

    Someone is trying to do something against me.

    Now I understand what Shru said, he indeed gave me a reason to be interested in what he is doing. . . And now I feel offended and somehow a bit lost.

    . . .

    Now what should I do?

    . . .

    . . .

    . . .

    <hr>
    <p style="font-style: italic;">CRASH!

    CRASH!

    CRASH!</p><hr>
    “AHHH!”

    A loud crash. . .

    “What. . . What was that?”

    Opening my eyes, I was welcomed by my room covered in the darkness, and there was no sign of something that could have made that loud crash noise.

    I looked around my darkened room, feeling my hands slightly trembling as my heart pounded in my chest. The sound had been so real, as if something had crashed right inside my room.

    I clutched my bedsheets tightly, trying to calm myself down. The nightmare had felt all too familiar, like a haunting memory that wouldn't let go.

    I switched on the light, brightening my surroundings, but there was no sign of anything that could have caused such a noise.

    A bit lost, I sat up beside the bed.

    Feeling my way through with slow, steady breaths, I find myself surrounded by the silence of midnight.

    "It's just a dream,", I reassure myself.

    A dream that's all too familiar and won't fade away.

    In the middle of the silence, I can hear my brother's anguished cries...

    <p style="font-style: italic;">Help me.

    Help me. .

    Help me, brother!!!</p>
    I shake my head and cover both of my ears, then take slow breaths. The sounds gradually become lower and lower, until I can't hear anything anymore.

    I need to get a grip.

    Attempting to dispel the lingering effects of the nightmare, I convince myself to calm down.

    . . .

    "The family picture surely caused this."

    I reach out to the table in my room and grab the one picture that's there.

    My brother is still here, but...

    I crumple the picture.

    "Sorry." Then I throw the crumpled picture into the trash can beside the table.

    . . .

    I should sleep.

    I turn off the lights and lie down on the bed.

    Looking straight up at the white ceiling, I once again wonder who Shru is.

    <hr>
    <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: -35px;"> < Thursday Morning > </p>

    My eyes feel heavier than usual, the feeling of not being able to sleep properly.

    Constantly thinking about who Shru is and not having any idea who could it be other than Septo.

    This guy? Even by looking at him, I can’t just think he can possibly do that.

    The idea of him doing something against me. . . I can’t imagine any of that happening.

    Shru knew about my brother. . . How could Septo possibly know about it when he is not even a student at my past school. He simply didn’t know anything about me before the 6th grade, and his being able to know what happened to my past just doesn’t make any sense.

    “You okay dude?”

    “Oh?”

    A bit surprised by his sudden talking.

    “Yeah, yeah I’m fine.”, I answered.

    “Thinking of something?”

    “Just a bit sleepy.”

    “Hahaha, I feel you, there are times I want to stay awake past midnight.”

    I opened my smartphone and showed him the game I’d been playing for the past few weeks.

    “Can’t resist playing this one.”. I said as if I stayed up too late because of the game.

    “I never played this one before, is it good?”

    “Just normal, but it’s kind of addicting to upgrade your weapons throughout the game.”

    “That’s normal, but it does look fun, I’ll guess it’s worth the try.”

    “Whose arm is this?”. A loud voice suddenly emerges inside the class.

    Everyone looked at the front, one of my classmates is holding something in his hand.

    "This one." He said, then he flipped the thing in his hand.

    An arm?

    Everyone started standing up from their seats just to see whose arm is he talking about.

    I couldn’t see if it was a picture or something, but I guess it’s a picture, as it doesn’t even look like an arm.

    A bit curious myself I tried seeing the arm myself.

    Seeing it close, it’s definitely an arm of a person, in a picture.

    Who would have thought we would find a picture of someone’s arm.

    Everyone was confused by the existence of the picture, some even laugh at the randomness of such a thing. No one probably expected something like this in their whole life. . . It must have been from someone who likes arms.

    That sounds freaky.

    They started comparing everyone’s arms, thinking it must be the arm of someone from the class. But they couldn’t find someone whose arm is the same as in the picture, simply because the arm in the picture is short, no one in the class probably has short arms like that.

    It’s more of a kid’s arm, because that’s what it looks like.

    *phone vibrates* I reach out my phone from my pocket and grab it.

    <p style="font-style: italic;"> A new email. ]</p>
    An email?

    <p style="font-style: italic;">[ (no title) ]</p>
    There’s no title in it, and after opening it there’s something inside, there’s an attachment file.

    I returned to my seat, still looking at the random email from someone.

    I hesitated for a moment before deciding to open the attachment file.

    My eyes widen from seeing the picture.

    And my heart races as I examine the picture in the email.

    I couldn’t believe my eyes, that I would see this face once again, the face I’d been running away, and the face that’s been haunting me for years.

    How. . .

    I suddenly felt a light tap on my shoulder, and I jumped.

    <p style="font-style: italic;">“Leo. . .”</p>
    . . .

    I turn and look beside me. . .

    “W-who’s there?”. I turned and looked, but there was no one beside me.

    As I looked back, I found my eyesight wandering in the darkness.

    <p style="font-style: italic;">“Leo. . .”</p>
    A faint voice. . .

    “Who. . . Who are you?”

    <p style="font-style: italic;">“Leo, why did you leave me?”</p>
    The voice is getting louder, as if he is pleading for an answer.

    I felt a chill down my spine as fear and confusion came to me.

    Trying to make sense of the situation I look around once again through the darkness.

    I found what seems to be a figure, but it’s unclear.

    “I didn’t leave you. . . I-I don’t understand what you are trying to say.”, I said with a trembling voice.

    I scratch my eyes, trying to take a better look at the figure.

    The figure starts going forward. . .

    Then suddenly, a bright light rushes into my eyes.

    “Leo?”

    Huh?

    “You’re alright?”

    Oh. . .

    I breathe a sigh of relief, realizing it’s just my classmate.

    “Y-yeah I’m fine, you just startled me, that’s all.”

    “You seemed lost in thought this day. You sure everything is okay?”

    I glanced back to my smartphone, the image still haunts me.

    “Yeah no worries, just lack of sleep. Thanks for asking though.”, I said while forcing a smile.

    “No problem.”, He nodded and returned back to his seat.

    I can hear the sound of my heartbeat, it’s loud and clear. . .

    It was just a picture, it’s just an imagination. . .

    I tried to brush off the fear, but the haunting words of my brother is still hunting me.

    Why is this happening to me. . .

    I tried to calm myself down.

    . . .

    After a while, I decided to look at the email again.

    It’s the face of my brother, and there’s also a message below it.

    <p style="font-style: italic;">[ Oh, if you didn’t notice yet, the picture of that arm is from your brother. ]</p>
    <hr>
    <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: -35px;"> < Friday Afternoon > </p>

    I didn’t manage to get any sleep today.

    Even without doing anything I already feel tired and sleepy.

    I can’t focus at all, but I still need to eat lunch at the moment.

    I grab my backpack feeling tired, but still decided to go to the canteen to eat my lunch.

    > > >

    “ ! “

    I glanced over my shoulder as I walk through the door of the canteen.

    There’s no one.

    But I feel like someone is looking at me.

    “Probably my mind is playing tricks at me.”

    Most likely something about me getting tired and hungry. I should get something to eat.

    After getting my lunch, I proceeded to find a seat at one of the empty tables. It seemed like most people had already finished eating their lunch, as there were fewer people in the canteen now.

    With fewer people, I feel like the air is more chilly than usual.

    I took a bite, trying to push away the uneasiness I’d been feeling.

    But for some reason. . .

    I looked at my lunch.

    It doesn’t look appetizing, and it felt tasteless.

    I didn’t enjoy eating lunch today.

    <p style="font-style: italic;">“Leo. . . Leo . . .”</p>
    “ ! “

    Suddenly I felt a chill down my spine as I hear a faint whisper in my ear.

    I turned my head around, finding no one.

    “. . .”

    My thoughts were a jumbled mess, and I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being watched.

    I resumed eating, feeling nervous about what I just heard.

    As I was about to finish eating, I saw a figure at the door. 

    Startled by the sight, a second after I blinked, it was nowhere to be seen.

    There’s something off about this.

    *gulps* I need to get out of here fast.

    I quickly leave the canteen.

    I can’t shake the feeling that someone is watching me.

    Constantly looking over my shoulder, feeling like someone is following me.

    “This can’t be real.”

    As I reached the classroom, I didn't waste any time and immediately took a seat, trying to calm my nerves.

    > > >

    The class started a moment ago, but I can’t concentrate.

    *glances around*

    The feeling of being watched, I can’t stop glancing around.

    *feet stomping continuously*

    “I can’t take this.”

    Suddenly, I stand up and rush to the exit.

    “Leo?”

    > > >

    Walking aimlessly, my mind is going all over the place.

    As I walk, the world seems to slow down, and my head feels heavier with each step.

    “There’s no one. . . There’s no one following me, there can’t be someone.”

    I collapsed on the near chair outside the building.

    *trembling* “What is happening? Why do I feel like this?”

    *slowly takes a deep breath*

    I can’t calm down at all, the feeling won’t go away.

    *looks around*

    “Please. . . Just leave me alone.”

    . . .

    <hr>
    <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: -35px;"> < Friday Evening > </p>

    “Arghhh. . .”

    I hold my head, feeling the slight pain from it.

    “. . .“

    Everything is dark. . . I can’t see anything.

    I quickly reach into my pockets, grabbing my smartphone out of it.

    I turn it on, and I was surprised by the sudden brightness of the phone.

    “Oh. . .”

    It’s already 7:07 PM, that’s why it’s incredibly dark in here. I can’t see anything other than the phone’s screen.

    I turn up the brightness to its maximum and made use of the brightness to look at the surroundings.

    Every place covered in darkness sure looks creepy.

    I continue looking around the house by using the phone’s brightness.

    “Huh?”

    *drops phone*

    “OH SHIT!!!”

    I quickly touch the ground, attempting to find the phone in the darkness.

    “WHERE ARE YOU?!”

    . . .

    I then manage to find it.

    *sighs in relief*

    I can’t see anything.

    I tap the screen, and nothing comes out. . .

    The phone got turned off because of the fall.

    *nervously taps the button*

    “Please. . . Please open up faster. . .”

    The booting of the phone seems slower than usual.

    Suddenly something black blocks the screen.

    *throws the phone away*

    *punching* “AHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!! GO AWAY! STOP! AHHHHHH!!!”

    NO! NOOO!!

    *runs away*

    *thud*

    *holds head*

    “AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!” *screams in pain*

    “WHERE IS IT? WHERE IS ITTT!!!”

    I feel along the wall.

    And I can’t find the switch.

    “WHERE IS IT!”

    Moving sideways and constantly touching the wall, I can’t find any switch.

    *turns back away to the wall*

    *looks side to side*

    I started waving both of my arms intensely to feel the surroundings.

    “Hah. . . Hah. . .”

    Catching my breath, I can’t seem to feel anything with my hand other than the wall behind me.

    *walks sideways*

    *feels something in his right hand*

    “ ! “

    What’s this. . .

    <p style="font-style: italic;">“Brother. . .”</p>
    “AH!!!”

    The thing suddenly moves and engulfs my whole palm. . .

    <p style="font-style: italic;">“Brother, DON’T LET GO OF MY HAND!!!!!!!” *shouts*</p>
    *aggressively shakes both hands*

    “AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!”

    “WHERE IS THE SWITCH! PLEASE!!!”

    I can’t. . .

    I keep looking for it until I felt something again.

    *clicks*

    Light illuminates the room.

    *knees fell*

    “Ouch!”

    Finally. Finally.

    *body falls forward*

    “I-I’m sorry. . .”

    *cries*

    “I’m sorry. . . I’m sorry. . . I’m sorry. . . I’m sorry. . . I’m sorry. . . I’m sorry. . . I’m sorry. . . I’m sorry. . . I’m sorry. . . I’m sorry. . . I’m sorry. . . I’m sorry. . . I’m sorry. . .

    I found myself lying on the bed.

    My eyes are swollen from crying.

    . . .

    *looks around*

    They probably brought me here.

    I don’t remember how I manage to get in here.

    I hold my chest. . .

    Is he that angry with me?

    Is this why he is showing himself now?

    *clutches hand*

    I feel like I’m gonna cry any second now.

    I’ve been running away for the past four years, and been shutting off him from my mind, trying to delete everything that happened.

    This is my punishment, this is my punishment.

    I should have expected that this is going to happen, I should have expected that this is going to happen at any time.

    He is angry at what I did, and I regret it. But instead of saying sorry, I run away. . .

    *opens up phone*

    I open up the emails, and the first thing I saw is the unknown email from Shru.

    I want to see his face once again.

    “ ! “

    There’s no face?

    “What?”

    I swear that I’d seen his face here. . . Why this picture has his face been removed?

    I tap the picture, and it has indeed no face.

    But I am sure I’ve seen his face in this email.

    *taps the picture repeatedly*

    "No way. . . Did I overlook it?"

    That might be the case. . .

    *phone vibrates*

    <p style="font-style: italic;">[ A new email. ]</p>
    *opens up*

    Another one from Shru. . .

    <p style="font-style: italic;">[ Oh right, I thought you might be missing your brother’s face.

    So, I thought of a little gift for you. 

    Happy birthday. . .

    Lark.]</p>
    “Huh?”

    Today is Lark’s birthday?

    I. . . Forgot about it, or more of like I made sure to forget everything about him.

    For some reason he knew about it, but how? How did he manage to do it?

    I can’t think of any reason.

    [ Lark.png ]

    This must be the one. . .

    What is he planning about this?

    *taps*

    “ ! “

    *pukes* 

    “Bleurghhh.”

    I feel my gut wrenching from the sight of my brother, drenched in blood and lifeless.

    *coughs*

    I feel a light tap on my shoulder.

    *looks beside*

    A dark human figure is standing looking at me.

    <p style="font-style: italic;">“I told you, brother, it’s all fine really.”</p>
    . . .

    “---“

    My voice won’t come out.

    “La---”

    I can’t say anything, I can’t voice out. . .

    Suddenly the dark figure's hands grab my shoulder and hold it tightly.

    "Aw!" I let out a small pain response as the hand touching my shoulder causes pain to my shoulder.

    I need to say something. . .

    I need to say something. . .

    I need to say something. . .

    As I was thinking on what I should respond. . .

    Blood lets from his head.

    I need to. . . Say. . .

    . . .

    “Ha-happy birthday. . . Lark.”
