    Who would have thought that a situation like this would occur to me, a folded paper is under my table.
    
    I haven’t open it yet, but I wonder if this is related to someone being interested in me. . . I wonder if that’s the case. . .
    
    Just kidding, there’s no way that would happen to me.
    
    I tried looking left and right, front, and back, but it doesn’t really look like someone is interested in me in this classroom.
    
    It’s very easy to say that simply because this class has been the same even in the elementary school, all the face of the people has been the same for years. We’ve been classmates for a long period of time, and that’s why. . .
    
    How come somebody started liking me after a long time, wouldn’t it normally start when most of the students don’t know each other yet, or that’s what I think.
    
    Let’s just get into it.
    
    As I said that, I slowly grab the folded paper under the table, and with a one movement I managed to open it. . .
    
    Guess what. . . From the looks of it, it’s not even a love letter.
    
    It says. . .
    
    <p style="font-style: italic">
    [ Comfort Room: 3 ]</p>
    
    So what is this? I tried looking at everyone at the classroom once again. . . 
    
    Whose prank is this!?
    
    I’m. . .
    
    “No way.”, I said in a low voice.
    
    My disappointment is immeasurable, this is what happens if you expect something romantic over a folded paper.
    
    As I was thinking how unfortunate that it is, I decided to rest my head out of disappointment. This certainly puts sadness to my face, and I guess it drains energy too.
    
    > > >
    
    I excused myself for a while, I need to relieve myself.
    
    As I entered one of the rooms, I noticed some numbers on the wall.
    
    <p style="font-style: italic">
    [ 1 9 0 4 1 8 0 7 2 3 ]</p>
    
    I scratched my head but decided to do first my initial plan for this moment.
    
    . . .
    
    Now that I’m done, from the length of the numbers itself, it looks like an ID number from one of the social media most people use. It’s a unique number for everyone’s account in the site.
    
    This makes me think why someone would write their own ID on the CR’s wall, because it doesn’t make any sense. But it would be a waste to not reach out to this ID, because who knows. . . It might be some interesting person. You know, it might be worthwhile especially I’m disappointed today because of someone’s prank.
    
    I reached out my right pocket and grabbed the folded paper. If I want to say something about the paper I’m currently holding, I honestly don’t know what the writing in this paper means.
    
    It says, Comfort Room 3. Considering how small this high school is, there are only two CRs in the whole school, the one for the girls, and one for the boys. So, the number 3 in here doesn’t make any sense.
    
    If there is something 3 over here. . .
    
    I don’t know, how is 3 connected to the CR.
    
    I tried opening all the rooms for each toilet in here, nothing unusual except for the one where I entered first, the one with the ID number. No other toilet rooms have that ID number, so I wonder if this is the 3 in the CR. . . Because there are 3 toilet rooms in here, so it must be talking about the room with the ID number. Counting from the right, it is the 3rd toilet room in the CR, so this must be it. . . I guess?
    
    But I guess, I found this thing somewhat interesting, this must mean that this is the ID number of the one who wrote in the folded paper.
    
    Come to think of it, won’t the other students be able to see the ID number inside the 3rd toilet room? Well, it’s not my problem if it’s miscalculation on his or her plan.
    
    Let’s try talking to this person later.
    
    <hr>
    <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: -35px;"> < Thursday Evening > </p>
    
    I just arrived at home, and it’s still early so I should just lay down in the bed to rest.
    
    As I lay down, I grab my phone out of my backpack. . .
    
    Oh right, the ID number. Let’s see what is this all about.
    
    I started typing the 10-digit ID number and tap the add friend button from the application. There is also a website version for this social media, and it’s rather convenient to have a phone application, I find it better than the website version.
    
    *ting*
    
    Oh. . . That was faster than I thought, it’s almost like this person is waiting for me to add the account.
    
    Shru. . . Is this even a real name of a person?
    
    I scrolled through the information, and it says “male”. . .
    
    I mean, I’m not really expecting for a girl to be interested in me.
    
    Lies. . .
    
    I am slightly hoping it’s going to be a girl. . .
    
    I let out a sigh.
    
    “Enough!”. Let’s just focus on this guy, what’s the deal with him?
    
    My phone vibrated. It’s a message from him, Hmmm. . .

    <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">
    - Shru -</p><p style="font-style: italic">
    [ What was written? ]</p>
    
    Written? He must be talking about the folded paper he wrote, or probably it’s not him who wrote that. Who knows, let’s ask first.

    <p style="text-align: right">
    [ You’re talking about the folded paper, right? ]</p>
    <p style="font-style: italic">
    [ What was written? ]</p>
    
    He repeated the same message, so it must be it, the Comfort Room 3.
    
    <p style="text-align: right">
    [ Comfort Room 3 ]</p>
    <p style="font-style: italic">
    [ Nice job! Nice to meet you Leo. ]</p>
    <p style="text-align: right">
    [ You know me? ]</p>
    <p style="font-style: italic">
    [ You’re popular, it’s normal. ]</p>
    <p style="text-align: right">
    [ I mean, do you know me personally? ]</p>
    <p style="font-style: italic">
    [ Not really. ]</p>
    <p style="text-align: right">
    [ Is that so. So what’s with this? You
    wrote something, and even did some
    code, password or something similar
    at the folded paper. ]</p>
    <p style="font-style: italic">
    [ Just testing, I thought it would
    be nice to see if you can
    understand what I wrote. ]</p>
    
    It’s just a coincidence I managed to find the 3rd toilet room itself, if somehow, I entered a different toilet room, there is a 100% chance I’m not going to see the ID number.
    
    <p style="text-align: right">
    [ It’s just a coincidence, I didn’t
    actually understand it that much. ]</p>
    <p style="font-style: italic">
    [ Doesn’t matter. Go with 1 in
    the next Monday, it’s limited
    to 8:15 AM only. ]</p>
    
    Huh. . . Why would I do that? What’s with this guy’s obsession in the CR, and it even has a time limit for some reason. Such a pain in the ass, I am not convinced enough to do this thing.
    
    <p style="text-align: right">
    [ Why should I do this? ] X</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
    Failed to send the message.</p>

    Huh? . . . Maybe a connection problem.
    
    Failed to send the message.
    
    I tried checking my connection, and it’s in full bar. . . I scroll through the application, and it seems working fine. No, it works fully fine.
    
    Let’s try resending the message.
    
    <p style="text-align: center">
    Failed to send the message.</p>
    <p style="text-align: center">
    Failed to send the message.</p>
    <p style="text-align: center">
    Failed to send the message.</p>
    
    Doesn’t seem to work. . . I should try sending test messages to someone. . . I think I should message Dad, I need to test if it’s really a connection problem or not.
    
    <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">
    - Dad -<p style="text-align: right">
    [ Dad, can you bring me some 
    juice drinks? ]</p>
    
    It works fine. . . Uh. . . I don’t know, let’s just forget about this.
    
    <p style="font-style: italic">
    [ Get it yourself. ]</p>
    <p style="text-align: right">
    [ Okay. ]</p>
    
    This must be some issue in the application itself.
    
    <hr>
    <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: -35px;"> < Friday Afternoon > </p>
    
    Class just ended. Finally, it’s the weekend, the only time I can laze around the home and do nothing.
    
    Nothing interesting happened for the first week, but I guess someone did arrived this new grade. I don’t know why, but for some reason he came back after two years. Nothing out of ordinary, and still the same dull person.
    
    Although I don’t know what Robert thinks about this. Kind of unexpected for Septo to transfer to a new school after two years, I really thought he didn’t choose this school because he wants to run away. But for some reason he is together with the same class again, he really likes getting bullied huh?
    
    But to be honest, I don’t know. . . I don’t want anything that is something to do with him, I don’t even fully understand what I was thinking in the 6th grade.
    
    Well, I guess these 2 years we are apart with Septo makes me realize some things. . .
    
    That I was a shitty person. . .
    
    It looks like Robert is not going to do anything, because he’s been quiet for a while. I honestly don’t understand his motives for bullying Septo. . . So, I’m not too sure if what’s he’s about to do.
    
    “You’re going home now?”
    
    “Yeah yeah, I just want to lay down the bed.”, I responded.
    
    “Right”. He chuckled. “See you.”
    
    I then waved goodbye to my friend.
    
    And it’s finally the time to do my best to sleep in the best and comfortable position. Just imagining the image of my bed makes me want to drool.
    
    As I exited the building, I turned around and send a salute sign.
    
    <hr>
    <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: -35px;"> < Friday Evening > </p>
    
    I was surfing through the net, since the problem about failing to send message to Shru is still a thing, it’s best to seek help to the mighty internet.
    
    I learned that Shru blocked my account. That’s the reason why I can’t send message.
    
    Now that I learned about that, I’m not too sure on what to feel about this. I can only see this Shru person to be playing pranks at me. Normally it’s best to stay away with this kind of person.
    
    I know I’m a bully, which kind of we are the same, a person that people should avoid. 
    
    In this case, I think it’s best to ignore this Shru person. But this kind of get me thinking, especially that he did some effort on putting the folded paper under my table and writing his ID number in the toilet room.
    
    Probably, it’s a classmate of mine.
    
    I did go back to check the ID number in the toilet room yesterday, but it was already gone. And I haven’t actually asked someone if they saw a person who inserted something under my table.
    
    So, the only thing I can think of is that it must be someone in the classroom. But a prank huh. . . I wonder what’s the motive for pranking me.
    
    “Ahhh. . .”
    
    When you are clueless about something, it’s not fun. I’m not some super genius detective, it’s only natural that I will not go as far as to being able to know who among my classmates is Shru. I don’t even know if Shru is a girl or a boy, I can only think of a boy who would do something like this.
    
    Shru did say that he doesn’t know me personally, so it must be someone who I am not closed with?
    
    “That’s like almost everyone.”
    
    I would not go as far as being close to everyone in the classroom, I only have two close friends, and almost everyone is just my classmates who I talk to casually.
    
    There are some people I can’t talk to that much, they are not talkative, and there are some quiet people who I don’t even see interacting with another person. They do exist, which kind of surprising.
    
    It’s their life, I’ll just leave them be.
    
    I let out a sigh.
    
    I’m sleepy. . .
    
    *yawn*
    
    “Goodnight Earth.”
    
    <hr>
    <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: -35px;"> < Monday Morning > </p>
    
    I just arrived at the school, exactly before the morning ceremony is about to start. Almost everyone is already in line with their own respective grade and sections.
    
    I still have 3 minutes before the flag raising ceremony began, but I felt the need to take a leak before going in line. I might skip the morning ceremony this time.
    
    I walk my way into the comfort room and get inside in one of the toilet rooms.
    
    . . .
    
    I checked the time and it’s already 8:02 AM, so I am two minutes late for the morning ceremony. I might as well hide myself in here, a teacher might see me outside and it would be a problem.
    
    So. . . What to do now. . .
    
    I wonder if there are people who hides themselves inside the comfort rooms, or not. . . 
    
    Maybe in one of toilet rooms, since it’s possible to hide yourself in here.
    
    That leaves the reason for hiding in here, I can only think of a loner as the reason for hiding here. But, I don’t think this is the best place to hide, as you might get suffocate from the smell. Luckily, today is Monday, so I’m probably the first person in here.
    
    I find myself looking for something dirty as I am looking at the corner and the floor of the comfort room.
    
    “It looks clean.”, I said to myself.
    
    I tried opening one of the toilet room, the one in the middle, and guess what. . . It’s clean as well, gonna give praise to the one who cleans the comfort rooms in this school, it’s a job well done. Might as well check the last toilet room. . . And. . . It’s also clean.
    
    “Oh?”
    
    There is something in the trash can, it’s a rather small trash can beside the toilet. I’m guessing someone already got in here before I did.
    
    <p style="font-style: italic">
    [ O P E N ]</p>
    
    Open? It’s rather a neat and clean one piece of paper, but it’s in the trash can so I’m a bit of hesitant to touch it. . .
    
    But right, it says open, so might as well take a look at it.
    
    I discarded my thoughts about not touching it and decided to pick it out of the trash can. It was a clean paper, and it says [ O P E N ]. It doesn’t look like it can be open, so I tried looking at the back side, and it says. . .
    
    <p style="font-style: italic">
    [ You can open it. ]</p>
    
    Another open, but I am not sure how to open this, so I looked through the sides of the paper and notice a tape.
    
    Oh. . . A clear tape. That’s why I haven’t notice it earlier.
    
    I tried removing the clear tape in the paper and opened it. There is a single piece of what I think a picture. It’s rather small, so it must be 1x1 picture of someone.
    
    I picked the picture up, and it was a picture of someone none other than. . .
    
    Me.
    
    What in the world is this. . . It’s a picture of me in 1x1 size, and I’m not sure how should I react to this.
    
    A picture of me, inside a paper that is in the trash can beside the toilet, and in the comfort room? What kind of person would think this is a good idea to begin with?
    
    “Ah.”
    
    Must be someone like Shru, the person who is obsessed with the comfort room itself. Is this one of his pranks again? I wonder what goes through in his mind that he even tried doing something like this, if this is something like a prank to mess with me, then I’m not sure how to feel about this.
    
    I look at the picture once again, and it’s not a proper picture, but rather it’s a selfie on me. It’s not a picture that something you can put in your ID card, it’s a selfie of me. I remember this, it’s from my social media account where I posted my pictures.
    
    What a way to play pranks to someone, that’s some effort to print my picture from the social media. It’s worth a reply, let’s try sending him a message about this.
    
    I grab my phone from my backpack and open the application to find Shru’s contact information. As I open it, I saw his last message from Thursday evening. . .
    
    I see, I understand now. I also look at the time, it’s already 8:14 AM. I wonder why there is a time limit, and it’s 8:15 AM.
    
    As I was wondering that, the CR’s door suddenly opens, and a few students get inside.
    
    “!”
    
    Ah. . . It’s the time limit for the morning ceremony. He must be saying that if I didn’t get in here first, there’s a possibility a random student might open the paper before me.
    
    Thinking about it, even when some random students saw this first before me, I wouldn’t even mind. It’s just a 1x1 picture of me, I don’t see any reason for me to be affected by this. 
    
    I guess it would be embarrassing if I was called out by someone and said that there’s a picture of me in the toilet. . . Oh right, I wouldn’t want that one to happen.
    
    Hah. . . I should just go to the classroom now and think about this later.
    
    <hr>
    <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: -35px;"> < Monday Afternoon > </p>
    
    As I was eating in the school canteen, my phone vibrated in my pocket.
    
    It’s a message from Shru, surprisingly. So that must mean he unblocked me, who would have thought right.
    
    <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">
    - Shru –</p><p style="font-style: italic">
    [ How was it? Did you got it? ]</p>
    <p style="text-align: right">
    [ I’m not sure what you’re talking
    about. ]</p>
    
    I should act that I don’t know what he is talking about, I can’t just let this person do pranks with me.
    
    <p style="font-style: italic">
    [ Is that so? ]</p>
    <p style="text-align: right">
    [ Yes. ]</p>
    <p style="font-style: italic">
    [ It’s your choice. ]</p>
    <p style="text-align: right">
    [ You expect me to do anything you
    wanted that easily? You know there’s
    no reason to do any of that. ]</p>
    <p style="font-style: italic">
    [ You’re right. Oh I forgot. . . ]</p>
    <p style="text-align: right">
    [ ? ]</p>
    <p style="font-style: italic">
    [ I decided to put a picture for
    my profile account here. ]</p>
    
    I peeked at his picture, and it’s my picture again, and again.
    
    Seeing that, I take a big bite at my lunch. I found myself eating my lunch a bit faster that I was normally eating. I’m getting tired of this, so I decided to not reply anymore.
    
    But my phone vibrated once again.
    
    <p style="font-style: italic">
    [ You must be getting tired by this,
    so I’ll give you a reason to be not.
    Sometime this week, you shall receive
    another picture, and it’s a lot bigger
    than the 1x1. Don’t be shy to accept it,
    a random student will give it you. ]</p>
    
    A long message from him, and he even said he is going to give me a reason to not be tired by these pranks. . . I don’t know what he meant by that, because how can I be possibly not get tired by this, I don’t even understand what he is trying to do. 
    
    I’m more likely to be annoyed by this rather than not get tired, it’s just like, you know it’s like absolutely nonsense.
    
    My lunch already got cold, but I still decided to eat it like I’m about to pass out of hunger. I’m confused on what to feel about this, all I know that things are about to get annoying with his appearance.
    
    I think I found someone who’s probably more crazier than everyone I’ve met in my whole life.
